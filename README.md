# Eppo Docs

https://docs.geteppo.com/

Eppo docs were built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/).

# Setup

```sh
$ yarn          # Install dependencies.
$ yarn start    # Start a development server and open browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.
$ yarn build    # Generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.
```

# Deploying

Deploy happens automatically when changes are pushed to `main`. Netlity monitors the repository and publishes them to https://docs.geteppo.com
