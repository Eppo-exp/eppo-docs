# SDK keys and environments

SDKs are used to determine the environment in which the SDK is being used. A flag can have a different status and different targeting rules for each environment.

 To create an SDK key navigate to the **SDK Keys** section of the **Feature Flags** page and click **New SDK Key**.

Note that by default Eppo has two environments: Test and Production, but you can add more on the **Environments** page.
