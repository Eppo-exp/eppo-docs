# SDK keys and environments

SDK keys are used to determine the environment in which the SDK is being used. A flag can have a different status and different targeting rules for each environment.

 To create an SDK key, navigate to the **SDK Keys** section of the **Configuration** section and click **New SDK Key**.

By default Eppo has two environments: Test and Production, but you can add more on the **Environments** page.
