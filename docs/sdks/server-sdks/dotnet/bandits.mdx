## Usage with Contextual Multi-Armed Bandits

Eppo also supports contextual multi-armed bandits. You can read more about them in the [high-level documentation](/contextual-bandits).
Bandit flag configuration--including setting up the flag key, status quo variation, bandit variation, and targeting rules--are configured within
the Eppo application. However, available actions are supplied to the SDK in the code when querying the bandit.

To leverage bandits using the .NET SDK, there are two additional steps over regular feature flags:
1. Add a bandit action logger to the SDK client instance
2. Query the bandit for an action

### Define a bandit assignment logger

In order for the bandit to learn an optimized policy, we need to capture and log the bandit's actions.
This requires defining a bandit logger in addition to an assignment logger.

```csharp
internal class BanditLogger : IAssignmentLogger
{
    public void LogAssignment(AssignmentLogData assignmentLogData)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("TODO: save assignment information to data warehouse", assignmentLogData);
    }

    public void LogBanditAction(BanditLogEvent banditLogEvent)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("TODO: save bandit action information to the data warehouse", banditLogEvent);
    }
}

// Initialize the SDK with both loggers provided
var eppoClientConfig = new EppoClientConfig("<SDK_KEY>", new BanditLogger());
var eppoClient = EppoClient.Init(eppoClientConfig);
```

The SDK will invoke the `LogBanditAction()` method with a `BanditLogEvent` object that contains the following fields:

| Field                                       | Description                                                                                                       | Example                          |
|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| `Timestamp` (DateTime)                      | The time when the action is taken in UTC                                                                           | "2024-03-22T14:26:55.000Z"       |
| `FlagKey` (string)                          | The key of the feature flag corresponding to the bandit                                                           | "bandit-test-allocation-4"       |
| `BanditKey` (string)                        | The key (unique identifier) of the bandit                                                                         | "ad-bandit-1"                    |
| `SubjectKey` (string)                       | An identifier of the subject or user assigned to the experiment variation                                         | "ed6f85019080"                   |
| `SubjectNumericAttributes` (IDictionary)    | Metadata about numeric attributes of the subject. Map of the name of attributes their provided values             | `{"age": 30}`                    |

| `OptimalityGap` (double)                    | The difference between the score of the selected action and the highest-scored action                             | 456                              |

### Query the bandit for an action

To query the bandit for an action, use the `GetBanditAction()` method. The most specific implementation takes the following parameters:
- `flagKey` (string): The key of the feature flag corresponding to the bandit
- `subjectKey` (string): The key of the subject or user assigned to the experiment variation
- `subjectAttributes` (IDictionary): The subject's attributes
- `actions` (IDictionary): Map of actions (by name) to their categorical and numeric attributes
- `defaultValue` (string): The default *variation* to return if the flag is not successfully evaluated

```csharp
var subjectAttributes = new Dictionary<string, object?>()
{
    ["age"] = 30,
    ["country"] = "uk",
    ["pricingTier"] = "1"
};

var actions = new Dictionary<string, IDictionary<string, object?>>()
{
    ["nike"] = new Dictionary<string, object?>()
    {
        ["brandLoyalty"] = 0.4,
        ["from"] = "usa"
    },
    ["adidas"] = new Dictionary<string, object?>()
    {
        ["brandLoyalty"] = 2,
        ["from"] = "germany"
    }
};

var result = eppoClient.GetBanditAction(
    "flag-with-shoe-bandit",
    "user123",
    subjectAttributes,
    actions,
    "default");

if (result.Action != null)
{
    // Follow the Bandit action
    RenderShoeAd(result.Action);
} else {
    // User was not selected for a Bandit.
    // A variation is still assigned.
    RenderDefaultShoeAd(result.Variation);
}
```

### `GetBanditAction` Overloads

There are several overloads of the `GetBanditAction()` method available:

For a simple list of actions without attributes:
```csharp
public BanditResult GetBanditAction(
    string flagKey,
    string subjectKey,
    IDictionary<string, object?> subjectAttributes,
    string[] actions,
    string defaultValue)
```

For a simple list of actions without attributes, using a `ContextAttributes` subject:
```csharp
public BanditResult GetBanditAction(
    string flagKey,
    ContextAttributes subject,
    string[] actions,
    string defaultValue)
```

Using `ContextAttributes` objects for subject and actions:
```csharp
public BanditResult GetBanditAction(
    string flagKey,
    ContextAttributes subject,
    IDictionary<string, ContextAttributes> actions,
    string defaultValue)
```

### Subject Context

The subject context contains contextual information about the subject that is independent of bandit actions.
For example, the subject's age or country.

The subject context can be provided as `IDictionary<string, object?>`, which will then assume anything that is a number is a numeric
attribute, and everything else is a categorical attribute.

You can also explicitly bucket the attribute types by providing the context as `ContextAttributes`. For example, you may have an attribute named `priority`, with 
possible values `0`, `1`, and `2` that you want to be treated categorically rather than numeric. `ContextAttributes` have two nested sets of attributes:
- `NumericAttributes` (IDictionary): A mapping of attribute names to their numeric values (e.g., `age: 30`)
- `CategoricalAttributes` (IDictionary): A mapping of attribute names to their categorical values (e.g., `country: "US"`)

```csharp
// Using ContextAttributes for explicit categorization
var subjectContext = new ContextAttributes("user123")
{
    NumericAttributes = new Dictionary<string, double>
    {
        ["age"] = 30,
        ["daysActive"] = 45
    },
    CategoricalAttributes = new Dictionary<string, string>
    {
        ["country"] = "US",
        ["priority"] = "1"  // Treating numeric value as categorical
    }
};
```

### Action Context

The action context contains contextual information about each action. They can be provided as a mapping of attribute names 
to their contexts. 

Similar to subject context, action contexts can be provided as: 

- `IDictionary<string, object?>` - which will then assume anything that is a number is a numeric attribute, and everything else is a categorical attribute 
- `ContextAttributes`, which have explicit bucketing into `NumericAttributes` and `CategoricalAttributes`.

If there is no action context, an array of strings comprising only the actions names can also be passed in.

```csharp
// Simple array of action names
string[] actions = new[] { "nike", "adidas", "puma" };

// Or with context
var actionsWithContext = new Dictionary<string, ContextAttributes>
{
    ["nike"] = new ContextAttributes("nike")
    {
        NumericAttributes = new Dictionary<string, double>
        {
            ["brandAffinity"] = 0.8,
            ["pricePoint"] = 120
        },
        CategoricalAttributes = new Dictionary<string, string>
        {
            ["category"] = "athletic",
            ["inStock"] = "true"
        }
    }
};
```

## Debugging

You may encounter a situation where a flag assignment produces a value that you did not expect. There are functions [detailed here](/sdks/sdk-features/debugging-flag-assignment/) to help you understand how flags are assigned, which will allow you to take corrective action on potential configuration issues.
