# Ruby

Eppo's Ruby SDK can be used for both feature flagging and experiment assignment:

- [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Eppo-exp/ruby-sdk)
- [RubyGems gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/eppo-server-sdk/)

## 1. Install the SDK

Install the SDK with gem:

```bash
gem install eppo-server-sdk
```

## 2. Initialize the SDK

Initialize the SDK with a SDK key, which can be generated in the Eppo interface. Initialization the SDK when your application starts up to generate a singleton client instance, once per application lifecycle:

```ruby
require 'eppo_client'

config = EppoClient::Config.new('<YOUR_API_KEY>')
client = EppoClient::init(config)
```

After initialization, the SDK begins polling Eppoâ€™s API at regular intervals to retrieve the most recent experiment configurations such as variation values and traffic allocation. The SDK stores these configurations in memory so that assignments are effectively instant. For more information, see the [architecture overview](/sdks/overview) page.

If you are using the SDK for experiment assignments, make sure to pass in an assignment logging callback (see [section](#define-an-assignment-logger-experiment-assignment-only) below).

:::info

By default the Eppo client initialization is asynchronous to ensure no critical code paths are blocked. For more information on handling non-blocking initialization, see our [documentation here](/sdks/common-issues#3-not-handling-non-blocking-initialization).

### Define an assignment logger (experiment assignment only)

If you are using the Eppo SDK for experiment assignment (i.e randomization), include a logger instance in the config that is passed to the `init` function on SDK initialization. The SDK invokes the `log_assignment` method in the instance to capture assignment data whenever a variation is assigned.

The code below illustrates an example implementation of logging with Segment, but you could also use other event-tracking systems. The only requirement is that the SDK can call a `log_assignment` method. Here we override Eppo's `AssignmentLogger` class with a function named `log_assignment`, then instantiate a config using an instance of the custom logger class, and finally instantiate the client:

```ruby
require 'segment/analytics'

# Connect to Segment (or your own event-tracking system)
Analytics = Segment::Analytics.new({ write_key: 'SEGMENT_WRITE_KEY' })

class CustomAssignmentLogger < EppoClient::AssignmentLogger
  def log_assignment(assignment)
    Analytics.track(assignment["subject"], "Eppo Assignment", assignment)
  end
end

config = EppoClient::Config.new(
  '<YOUR_API_KEY>',
  assignment_logger: CustomAssignmentLogger.new
)
client = EppoClient::init(config)
```

The SDK will invoke the `log_assignment` function with an `assignment` object that contains the following fields:

| Field                     | Description                                                                                                              | Example                             |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| `experiment` (string)     | An Eppo experiment key                                                                                                   | "recommendation-algo-allocation-17" |
| `subject` (string)        | An identifier of the subject or user assigned to the experiment variation                                                | UUID                                |
| `variation` (string)      | The experiment variation the subject was assigned to                                                                     | "control"                           |
| `timestamp` (string)      | The time when the subject was assigned to the variation                                                                  | 2021-06-22T17:35:12.000Z            |
| `subjectAttributes` (map) | A Hash of metadata about the subject. These attributes are only logged if passed to the SDK assignment function | `{ "country": "US" }`               |
| `featureFlag` (string)    | An Eppo feature flag key                                                                                                 | "recommendation-algo"               |
| `allocation` (string)     | An Eppo allocation key                                                                                                   | "allocation-17"                     |

:::note
More details about logging and examples (with Segment, Rudderstack, mParticle, and Snowplow) can be found in the [event logging](/sdks/event-logging/) page.

## 3. Assign variations

Assigning users to flags or experiments with a single `get_string_assignment` function:

```ruby
require 'eppo_client'

client = EppoClient::Client.instance
variation = client.get_string_assignment(
  '<SUBJECT-KEY>',
  '<FLAG-KEY>',
  '<DEFAULT-VARIATION>',
  {
    # Optional map of subject metadata for targeting.
  }
)
```

The `get_string_assignment` function takes three required and one optional input to assign a variation:

- `subject_key` - The entity ID that is being experimented on, typically represented by a uuid.
- `flag_key` - This key is available on the detail page for both flags and experiments. Can also be an experiment key.
- `default_variation` - The variation that will be returned if no allocation matches the subject, if the flag is not enabled, if `get_string_assignment` is invoked before the SDK has finished initializing, or if the SDK was not able to retrieve the flag configuration.
- `subject_attributes` - An optional map of metadata about the subject used for targeting. If you create rules based on attributes on a flag/experiment, those attributes should be passed in on every assignment call.

The `get_string_assignment` function takes two required and one optional input to assign a variation:

- `subject_key` - The entity ID that is being experimented on, typically represented by a uuid.
- `flag_or_experiment_key` - This key is available on the detail page for both flags and experiments.
- `subject_attributes` - An optional map of metadata about the subject used for targeting. If you create rules based on attributes on a flag/experiment, those attributes should be passed in on every assignment call.

### Typed assignments

The following typed functions are available:

```
get_boolean_assignment(...)
get_integer_assignment(...)
get_numeric_assignment(...)
get_string_assignment(...)
get_json_assignment(...)
```

### Debugging

If you need more visibility into why `get_string_assignment` is returning a certain value, you can change the logging level to `Logger::DEBUG` to see more details in the standard output.

```ruby
require 'eppo_client'
require 'logger'

client = EppoClient::Client.instance
variation = client.get_string_assignment(
  '<SUBJECT-KEY>',
  '<FLAG-KEY>',
  '<DEFAULT-VARIATION>',
  {},
  Logger::DEBUG
)
```

:::note
It may take up to 10 seconds for changes to Eppo experiments to be reflected by the SDK assignments.
