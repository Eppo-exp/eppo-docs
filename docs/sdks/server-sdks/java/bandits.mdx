## Usage with Contextual Multi-Armed Bandits

Eppo supports contextual multi-armed bandits. You can read more about them in the [high-level documentation](/contextual-bandits).
Bandit flag configuration--including setting up the flag key, status quo variation, bandit variation, and targeting rules--are configured within
the Eppo application. However, available actions are supplied to the SDK in the code when querying the bandit.

To leverage bandits using the Java SDK, there are two additional steps over regular feature flags:
1. Add a bandit action logger to the SDK client instance
2. Query the bandit for an action

### Define a bandit assignment logger

In order for the bandit to learn an optimized policy, we need to capture and log the bandit's actions.
This requires defining a bandit logger in addition to an assignment logger.

```java
EppoClient.Builder()
  .apiKey(apiKey)
  .assignmentLogger(assignmentLogData -> {
    System.out.println("TODO: send assignment event data to data warehouse: " + assignmentLogData);
  })
  .banditLogger(banditLogData -> {
    System.out.println("TODO: also send bandit event data to data warehouse, ensuring the column names are as expected: " + banditLogData);
  })
  .buildAndInit();
```

The bandit logger receives an event object with the following fields:

<ApiOptionRef 
  name="timestamp"
  type="Date"
  defaultValue="undefined"
>

The time when the action is taken
</ApiOptionRef>

<ApiOptionRef 
  name="featureFlag"
  type="String"
  defaultValue="undefined"
>

The key of the feature flag corresponding to the bandit
</ApiOptionRef>

<ApiOptionRef 
  name="bandit"
  type="String"
  defaultValue="undefined"
>

The key of the bandit
</ApiOptionRef>

<ApiOptionRef 
  name="subject"
  type="String"
  defaultValue="undefined"
>

The identifier of the subject
</ApiOptionRef>

<ApiOptionRef 
  name="subjectNumericAttributes"
  type="Attributes"
  defaultValue="{}"
>

Metadata about numeric attributes of the subject
</ApiOptionRef>

<ApiOptionRef 
  name="subjectCategoricalAttributes"
  type="Attributes"
  defaultValue="{}"
>

Metadata about non-numeric attributes of the subject
</ApiOptionRef>

<ApiOptionRef 
  name="action"
  type="String"
  defaultValue="undefined"
>

The action assigned by the bandit
</ApiOptionRef>

<ApiOptionRef 
  name="actionNumericAttributes"
  type="Attributes"
  defaultValue="{}"
>

Metadata about numeric attributes of the assigned action
</ApiOptionRef>

<ApiOptionRef 
  name="actionCategoricalAttributes"
  type="Attributes"
  defaultValue="{}"
>

Metadata about non-numeric attributes of the assigned action
</ApiOptionRef>

<ApiOptionRef 
  name="actionProbability"
  type="Double"
  defaultValue="undefined"
>

The weight between 0 and 1 the bandit valued the assigned action
</ApiOptionRef>

<ApiOptionRef 
  name="optimalityGap"
  type="Double"
  defaultValue="undefined"
>

The difference between the score of the selected action and the highest-scored action
</ApiOptionRef>

<ApiOptionRef 
  name="modelVersion"
  type="String"
  defaultValue="undefined"
>

The key for the version of the bandit parameters used
</ApiOptionRef>

### Query the bandit for an action

To query the bandit for an action, use the `getBanditAction()` function:

```java
String flagKey = "shoe-bandit";
String subjectKey = "user123";

// `DiscriminableAttributes` is a set of attributes which can present the attributes sorted into numeric and categorical
// The `Attributes` class sorts these automatically based on data type.
DiscriminableAttributes subjectAttributes = new Attributes(
  Map.of(
    "age", EppoValue.valueOf(25),
    "country", EppoValue.valueOf("BG")
  )
);

// `BanditActions` is a map of action key to a set of attributes.
Actions actions = new BanditActions(
  Map.of(
    "nike",
    new Attributes(
      Map.of(
        "brandAffinity", EppoValue.valueOf(2.3),
        "previouslyPurchased", EppoValue.valueOf(true)
      )
    ),
    "adidas",
    new Attributes(
      Map.of(
        "brandAffinity", EppoValue.valueOf(0.2),
        "previouslyPurchased", EppoValue.valueOf(false)
      )
    )
  )
);

String defaultValue = "control";

BanditResult banditResult = EppoClient.getInstance().getBanditAction(
  flagKey,
  subjectKey,
  subjectAttributes,
  actions,
  defaultValue
);

if (banditResult.getAction() != null) {
  renderShoeAd(banditResult.getAction());
} else {
  renderDefaultShoeAd();
}
```

#### Subject Context

The subject context contains contextual information about the subject that is independent of bandit actions.
For example, the subject's age or country.

The subject context can be provided as `Attributes`, which will then assume anything that is number is a numeric
attribute, and everything else is a categorical attribute.

You can also explicitly bucket the attribute types by providing the context as `ContextAttributes`. For example, you may
have an attribute named `priority`, with possible values `0`, `1`, and `2` that you want to be treated categorically rather
than numeric.

```java
Attributes subjectNumericAttributes = new Attributes(
  Map.of(
    "age", EppoValue.valueOf(30)
  )
);
Attributes subjectCategoricalAttributes = new Attributes(
  Map.of(
    "priority", EppoValue.valueOf(1),
    "country", EppoValue.valueOf("GB")
  )
);
ContextAttributes subjectAttributes = new ContextAttributes(
  subjectNumericAttributes, 
  subjectCategoricalAttributes
);
```

#### Action Contexts

The action context contains contextual information about each action. They can be provided as a mapping of attribute names
to their contexts.

Similar to subject context, action contexts can be provided as `Attributes` or as `ContextAttributes`. If there is no action
context, you can use a `Set<String>` of all the action names when constructing `BanditActions`.

If the subject is assigned to the variation associated with the bandit, the bandit selects one of the supplied actions.
All actions supplied are considered to be valid. If an action should not be available to a subject, do not include it for
that call.

#### Result

`getBanditAction()` returns a `BanditResult` which has two fields:
- `variation` (String): The variation that was assigned to the subject
- `action` (String | null): The action that was assigned to the subject by the bandit, or `null` if the bandit was not 
  assigned

When `action` is not `null`, the bandit has selected an action for the subject. Otherwise, you should use your status quo
algorithm to select an action.

#### Status Quo Algorithm

In order to accurately measure the performance of the bandit, we need to compare it to the status quo algorithm using an 
experiment. This status quo algorithm could be a complicated algorithm that selects an action according to a different 
model, or a simple baseline such as selecting a fixed or random action. When you create an analysis allocation for the 
bandit and the returned `action` is `null`, implement the desired status quo algorithm based on the `variation` value.
