The Eppo Go SDK is easy to initialize while offering robust customization options, making it adaptable to various use cases such as offline mode, custom caching requirements, and ultra-low-latency initialization.

## Initialize the SDK

To complete basic initialization, you only need to provide an SDK key. [Create an SDK key](/sdks/sdk-keys) if you don't already have one.

```go
import (
    "github.com/Eppo-exp/golang-sdk/v6/eppoclient"
)

config := eppoclient.Config{
    SdkKey: "<SDK-KEY>",
}
client, err := eppoclient.InitClient(config)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal("Failed to initialize Eppo client:", err)
}
```

## Waiting for Initialization

The SDK provides a channel to wait for initialization to complete. This is useful in server applications where you want to ensure the SDK is ready before handling requests:

```go
select {
case <-client.Initialized():
    log.Println("Eppo SDK initialized successfully")
case <-time.After(2 * time.Second):
    log.Warn("Timed out waiting for Eppo SDK to initialize")
}
```

## Advanced Configuration

Basic initialization is great for most use cases, but the SDK provides options that you can use during initialization to customize the behavior of the SDK.

### Configuration Options

The `Config` struct accepts the following options:

<ApiOptionRef
  name="SdkKey"
  type="string"
  defaultValue='""'
>

Your SDK key from the Eppo dashboard. Required.
</ApiOptionRef>

<ApiOptionRef
  name="AssignmentLogger"
  type="IAssignmentLogger"
  defaultValue="nil"
>

A callback that sends each assignment to your data warehouse. Required only for experiment analysis.
</ApiOptionRef>

<ApiOptionRef
  name="BaseUrl"
  type="string"
  defaultValue='"https://fscdn.eppo.cloud/api"'
>

The base URL for the Eppo API.
</ApiOptionRef>

<ApiOptionRef
  name="PollerInterval"
  type="time.Duration"
  defaultValue="10 * time.Second"
>

The interval at which the SDK polls for configuration updates.
</ApiOptionRef>


For example, to configure custom polling intervals and timeouts:

```go
config := eppoclient.Config{
    SdkKey:          "<SDK-KEY>",
    AssignmentLogger: &MyLogger{},
    PollInterval:     60 * time.Second,
    InitialWaitTime:  5 * time.Second,
}
```


## Best Practices

1. **Initialize Once**: Create a single instance of the SDK at application startup and reuse it throughout your application.

2. **Handle Errors**: Always implement error handling around initialization to make sure errors don't disrupt your application.

4. **Monitor Memory**: Be mindful of memory usage when setting polling intervals, as configurations are cached in memory.
