The Eppo Rust SDK enables feature flags and experiments in your Rust applications with only a few lines of code.

The SDK handles all the complexity of feature flag evaluation and experiment assignment locally in your application, with no network calls required after initial setup.

## Installation

First, add the SDK as a dependency using Cargo:

```sh
cargo add eppo
```

## Feature Flags

Feature flags are a way to toggle features on and off without needing to deploy code.

### Initialize the SDK

[Create an SDK key](/sdks/sdk-keys) if you don't already have one.

```rust
let mut client = eppo::ClientConfig::from_api_key("<YOUR_API_KEY>")
    .to_client();

let poller_thread = client.start_poller_thread();
```

### Assign a variant

Once initialized, you can use the client to make assignments. Each assignment requires:

- **Flag Key**: Identifies which set of configuration rules to use
- **Subject Key**: A unique identifier for the subject (usually a user ID)
- **Subject Attributes**: Optional key-value pairs containing additional information used for rule evaluation

```rust
let variation = client
    .get_string_assignment(
        "<FLAG_KEY>",
        "<SUBJECT_KEY>",
        <SUBJECT_ATTRIBUTES>,
    )
    .inspect_err(|err| eprintln!("error assigning a flag: {:?}", err))
    .unwrap_or_default()
    .unwrap_or("<DEFAULT_VALUE>".to_owned());

if variation == "fast_checkout" {
    // Handle fast checkout
} else {
    // Handle other variations
}
```

### Assignment Types

The SDK provides different assignment functions based on the type of value you need:

| Function | Return Type |
|----------|-------------|
| `get_string_assignment()` | `Str` |
| `get_boolean_assignment()` | `bool` |
| `get_json_assignment()` | `serde_json::Value` |
| `get_integer_assignment()` | `i64` |
| `get_numeric_assignment()` | `f64` |

## Experiments

For experiments, you'll need to implement assignment logging to track how users interact with different variations.

```rust
use eppo::AssignmentLogger;

struct MyAssignmentLogger;

impl AssignmentLogger for MyAssignmentLogger {
    fn log_assignment(&self, assignment: AssignmentEvent) {
        println!("{:?}", assignment);
    }
}

let mut client = ClientConfig::from_api_key("<YOUR_API_KEY>")
    .assignment_logger(MyAssignmentLogger)
    .to_client();

let poller_thread = client.start_poller_thread();
```

:::note
In a production application, you would want to replace the `println!()` statement with an actual logging system.

## Next Steps

Now that you've seen how to make assignments with the Eppo Rust SDK, we strongly recommend familiarizing yourself with the following topics:

- [Initialization Configuration](/sdks/server-sdks/rust/initialization)
- [Assignment details](/sdks/server-sdks/rust/assignments)
