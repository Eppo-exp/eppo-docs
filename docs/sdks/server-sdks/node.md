# Node

Eppo's open source Node SDK can be used for both feature flagging and experiment assignment:

- [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Eppo-exp/node-server-sdk)
- [API Reference](https://eppo-exp.github.io/node-server-sdk/node-server-sdk.html)
- [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@eppo/node-server-sdk)

## Getting Started

### Install the SDK

You can install the SDK with Yarn or NPM:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="yarn" label="Yarn">

```bash
yarn add @eppo/node-server-sdk
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="npm" label="NPM">

```bash
npm install @eppo/node-server-sdk
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Define an assignment logger

Eppo encourages centralizing application logging as much as possible. Accordingly, instead of implementing a new logging framework, Eppo's SDK integrates with your existing logging system via a logging callback function defined at SDK initialization.

The code below illustrates an example implementation of a logging callback to the console and other event platforms. You could also use your own logging system, the only requirement is that the SDK receives a `logAssignment` function. Here we define an implementation of the Eppo `IAssignmentLogger` interface containing a single function named `logAssignment`:

<TabItem value="console" label="Console">

```javascript
// Import Eppo's assignment logger interface and client initializer
import { IAssignmentLogger, init } from "@eppo/node-server-sdk";

// Define logAssignment so that it logs events

  logAssignment(assignment) {
		console.log(assignment)
  },
};

// Initialize the client
await init({
  apiKey: "<SDK_KEY>",
  assignmentLogger,
});

// Then every call to getAssignment will also log the event
const eppoClient = EppoSdk.getInstance();
const variation = eppoClient.getAssignment(
  "<SUBJECT-KEY>",
  "<FLAG-KEY>",
  {
    // Optional metadata about the user to be used for targeting

#### Avoiding duplicated assignment logs

Eppo's SDK uses an internal cache to ensure that duplicate assignment events are not logged to the data warehouse. While Eppo's analytic engine will automatically deduplicate assignment records, this internal cache prevents firing unnecessary events and can help minimize costs associated with event logging. 

### Initialize the SDK

Initialize the SDK with an SDK key, which can be generated [in the Eppo interface](https://eppo.cloud/feature-flags/keys). Initialization should happen when your application starts up to generate a singleton client instance, once per application lifecycle:

```javascript
import { init } from "@eppo/node-server-sdk";

await init({
  apiKey: "<SDK_KEY>",
  assignmentLogger,
});
```

After initialization, the SDK begins polling Eppoâ€™s API at regular intervals to retrieve the most recent experiment configurations such as variation values and traffic allocation. The SDK stores these configurations in memory so that assignments thereafter are effectively instant. For more information, see the [architecture overview](/sdks/overview) page.




### Assign variations

Assigning users to flags or experiments with a single `getStringAssignment` function:

```javascript
import * as EppoSdk from "@eppo/node-server-sdk";

const eppoClient = EppoSdk.getInstance();
const variation = eppoClient.getStringAssignment(
  "<SUBJECT-KEY>",
  "<FLAG-KEY>",
  {
    // Optional map of subject metadata for targeting.
  }
);
```

The `getStringAssignment` function takes two required and one optional input to assign a variation:

- `subjectKey` - The entity ID that is being experimented on, typically represented by a uuid.
- `flagOrExperimentKey` - This key is available on the detail page for both flags and experiments.
- `subjectAttributes` - An optional map of metadata about the subject used for targeting. If you create rules based on attributes on a flag/experiment, those attributes should be passed in on every assignment call.

### Example

See an end to end example below of setting up the Eppo Node client and logging events to the console.

```javascript
// Import Eppo's assignment logger interface and client initializer
import { IAssignmentLogger, init } from "@eppo/node-server-sdk";

// Define logAssignment so that it logs events
const assignmentLogger: IAssignmentLogger = {
  logAssignment(assignment) {
		console.log(assignment)
  },
};

// Initialize the client
await init({
  apiKey: "<SDK_KEY>",
  assignmentLogger,
});

// Then every call to getAssignment will also log the event
const user = {
  userid: '1234567890',
  attributes: { country: 'united states', subscription_status: 'gold' }
}

const eppoClient = EppoSdk.getInstance();
const variation = eppoClient.getAssignment(
  user.userid,
  "new-user-onboarding",
  user.attributes
);
```
```javascript showLineNumbers
// Output
{
  allocation: 'allocation-2468',
  experiment: 'new-user-onboarding-allocation-2468',
  featureFlag: 'new-user-onboarding',
  variation: 'treatment',
  timestamp: '2024-03-21T18:58:23.176Z',
  subject: '1234567890',
  holdout: 'q1-holdout',
  holdoutVariation: null,
  subjectAttributes: { country: 'united states', subscription_status: 'gold' }
}
```



## Handling `null`

We recommend always handling the `null` case in your code. Here are some examples illustrating when the SDK returns `null`:

1. The **Traffic Exposure** setting on experiments/allocations determines the percentage of subjects the SDK will assign to that experiment/allocation. For example, if Traffic Exposure is 25%, the SDK will assign a variation for 25% of subjects and `null` for the remaining 75% (unless the subject is part of an allow list).

2. Assignments occur within the environments of feature flags. You must enable the environment corresponding to the feature flag's allocation in the user interface before `getStringAssignment` returns variations. It will return `null` if the environment is not enabled.

![Toggle to enable environment](/img/feature-flagging/enable-environment.png)

3. If `getStringAssignment` is invoked before the SDK has finished initializing, the SDK may not have access to the most recent experiment configurations. In this case, the SDK will assign a variation based on any previously downloaded experiment configurations stored in local storage, or return `null` if no configurations have been downloaded.

<br />

:::note
It may take up to 10 seconds for changes to Eppo experiments to be reflected by the SDK assignments.

## Typed assignments

Use the following getAssignment method for the type of feature flag created:

```
getBoolAssignment(...)
getNumericAssignment(...)
getJSONStringAssignment(...)
getParsedJSONAssignment(...)
```
To read more about different flag types, see the page on [Flag Varitions](/feature-flagging/flag-variations).
## Initialization options

How the SDK fetches experiment configurations is configurable via additional optional initialization options:

| Option | Description | Default |
| ------ | ----------- | ------- | 
| **`requestTimeoutMs`** (number) | Timeout in milliseconds for HTTPS requests for the experiment configurations. | `5000` |
| **`numInitialRequestRetries`** (number) | Number of _additional_ times the initial configurations request will be attempted if it fails. This is the request typically synchronously waited (via `await`) for completion. A small wait will be done between requests. | `1` |
| **`pollAfterFailedInitialization`** (boolean) | Poll for new configurations even if the initial configurations request failed. | `false` |
| **`throwOnFailedInitialization`** (boolean) | Throw an error (reject the promise) if unable to fetch initial configurations during initialization. | `true` |
| **`numPollRequestRetries`** (number) | If polling for updated configurations after initialization, the number of additional times a request will be attempted before giving up. Subsequent attempts are done using an exponential backoff. | `7` |

## Assignment Logger schema

The SDK will invoke the `logAssignment` function with an `assignment` object that contains the following fields:

| Field                     | Description                                                                                                              | Example                             |
