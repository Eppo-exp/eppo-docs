The Eppo PHP SDK enables feature flags and experiments in your PHP applications with only a few lines of code.

## Installation

Install the SDK using Composer:

```bash
composer require eppo/php-sdk
```

## Initialize the SDK

Initialize the SDK with your SDK key:

```php
use Eppo\EppoClient;

require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';


$eppoClient = EppoClient::init(
   '<your_api_key>',
   '<base_url>', // optional, default https://fscdn.eppo.cloud/api
   $assignmentLogger, // optional, must be an instance of Eppo\Logger\LoggerInterface
   $cache // optional, must be an instance of PSR-16 SimpleCache\CacheInterface. If not passed, FileSystem cache will be used
   $httpClient // optional, must be an instance of PSR-18 ClientInterface. If not passed, Discovery will be used to find a suitable implementation
   $requestFactory // optional, must be an instance of PSR-17 Factory. If not passed, Discovery will be used to find a suitable implementation
);
```

## Feature Flags

### Make an Assignment

```php
$subjectAttributes = [];
$variation = $eppoClient->getStringAssignment('subject-1', 'experiment_5', $subjectAttributes);

if ($variation === 'control') {
    // do something
}
```

## Experiments 

For experiments, you'll need to implement logging. Here's a basic example:

```php
<?php

use Eppo\Logger\LoggerInterface;

class Logger implements LoggerInterface {
  public function logAssignment(
    string $experiment,
    string $variation,
    string $subject,
    string $timestamp,
    array $subjectAttributes = []
  ) {
    var_dump(
      json_encode([
        'experiment' => $experiment,
        'variation' => $variation,
        'subject' => $subject,
        'timestamp' => $timestamp,
      ]);
    );
  }
}
```

## Contextual Bandits

Contextual Multi-Armed Bandits are a way to dynamically optimize assignments based on user context. A bandit balances exploration of new actions with exploitation of known successful actions to maximize a specified metric.

### Bandit Setup

Setting up a bandit requires two loggers:
1. An assignment logger (same as experiments)
2. A bandit logger for recording bandit-specific events

[Code Placeholder: Implementation example of PHP bandit logger will be added in a future update]

### Query the bandit for actions

Instead of making simple assignments with a bandit, you query the bandit for actions. The bandit considers both the subject context (like user attributes) and action contexts (like product attributes) when making decisions.

[Code Placeholder: Example of querying a bandit for actions in PHP will be added in a future update]

The bandit will return both:
- A variation (indicating whether the subject is in the experiment)
- An action (the specific choice the bandit made, if the subject is in the experiment)
