The Eppo Ruby SDK enables feature flags and experiments in your Ruby applications with only a few lines of code.

The SDK handles all the complexity of feature flag evaluation and experiment assignment locally in your application, with no network calls required after initial setup. This guide will walk you through installing the SDK and implementing your first feature flag, experiment, and contextual bandit.

## Installation

First, install the SDK using gem:

```bash
gem install eppo-server-sdk
```

Or add to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'eppo-server-sdk', '~> 3.2.7'
```

## Feature Flags
Feature flags are a way to toggle features on and off without needing to deploy code.

### Initialize the SDK

[Create an SDK key](/sdks/sdk-keys) if you don't already have one. 

First, initialize the SDK using your SDK key:

```ruby
require 'eppo_client'

config = EppoClient::Config.new('<SDK-KEY>')
EppoClient::init(config)
```

:::note
The SDK key is different from the project API key. You can find your SDK key in the [SDK Keys section of the Eppo interface](https://eppo.cloud/configuration/environments/keys).
:::

### Assign a variant

Once initialized, you can get an instance of the client and start making assignments:

```ruby
client = EppoClient::Client.instance
variation = client.get_string_assignment(
  'show-new-feature',
  user.id,
  { 'country' => user.country },
  'control'
)

if variation == "variant-a"
  handle_variant_a
elsif variation == "variant-b"
  handle_variant_b
else
  handle_control
end
```

### Assignment Types

The SDK provides different assignment functions based on the type of value you need:

| Function | Return Type |
|----------|-------------|
| `get_string_assignment()` | String |
| `get_boolean_assignment()` | Boolean |
| `get_json_assignment()` | Hash |
| `get_integer_assignment()` | Integer |
| `get_numeric_assignment()` | Float |

:::note
See more details about assignment functions in the [Assignments](/sdks/server-sdks/ruby/assignments) page.
:::

## Experiments

While feature flags are useful, they do not send you any information about how your users are interacting with the feature. Experiments provide a way to collect data about these interactions using your preferred logging system.

To log events through the SDK, you need to implement the `AssignmentLogger` class:

```ruby
class MyLogger < EppoClient::AssignmentLogger
  def log_assignment(assignment)
    puts "Logging assignment: #{assignment}"  # Replace with your logging logic
  end
end

config = EppoClient::Config.new(
  '<SDK-KEY>',
  assignment_logger: MyLogger.new
)
EppoClient::init(config)
```

:::note
In a production application, you would want to replace the puts statement with an actual logging system. We have documentation on how to set up logging with multiple popular data warehouses and logging systems in the [Assignments page](/sdks/server-sdks/ruby/assignments/#logging-data-to-your-data-warehouse).
:::

## Contextual Bandits

Contextual Multi-Armed Bandits are a way to dynamically optimize assignments based on user context. A bandit balances exploration of new actions with exploitation of known successful actions to maximize a specified metric.

### Bandit Setup

Setting up a bandit requires implementing both an assignment logger and a bandit logger:

```ruby
class MyLogger < EppoClient::AssignmentLogger
  def log_assignment(assignment)
    puts "Logging assignment: #{assignment}"
  end
  
  def log_bandit_action(bandit_action)
    puts "Logging bandit action: #{bandit_action}"
  end
end

config = EppoClient::Config.new(
  '<SDK-KEY>',
  assignment_logger: MyLogger.new
)
EppoClient::init(config)
```

### Query the bandit for actions

Instead of making simple assignments with a bandit, you query the bandit for actions:

```ruby
client = EppoClient::Client.instance
bandit_result = client.get_bandit_action(
  "shoe-bandit",
  user.id,
  EppoClient::Attributes.new(
    numeric_attributes: { "age" => user.age },
    categorical_attributes: { "country" => user.country }
  ),
  {
    "nike" => EppoClient::Attributes.new(
      numeric_attributes: { "brand_affinity" => 2.3 },
      categorical_attributes: { "previously_purchased" => true }
    ),
    "adidas" => EppoClient::Attributes.new(
      numeric_attributes: { "brand_affinity" => 0.2 },
      categorical_attributes: { "previously_purchased" => false }
    )
  },
  "control"
)

if bandit_result.action
  show_shoe_ad(bandit_result.action)
else
  show_default_ad
end
```
