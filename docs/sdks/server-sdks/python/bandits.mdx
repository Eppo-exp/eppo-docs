Eppo's Python SDK supports contextual multi-armed bandits, which dynamically optimize assignments based on user context. A bandit balances exploration of new actions with exploitation of known successful actions to maximize a specified metric.

## Bandit Setup

To leverage Eppo's contextual bandits using the Python SDK, there are two additional steps over regular feature flags:
1. Add a bandit action logger to the assignment logger
2. Query the bandit for an action

### Logging Bandit Actions

In order for the bandit to learn an optimized policy, we need to capture and log the bandit's actions.
This requires implementing the `log_bandit_action` method in your `AssignmentLogger` class:

```python
from eppo_client import AssignmentLogger

class MyLogger(AssignmentLogger):
    def log_assignment(self, assignment):
        # Your assignment logging implementation
        pass

    def log_bandit_action(self, bandit_action):
        # Your bandit action logging implementation
        pass
```

### Bandit Action Schema

The SDK will invoke the `log_bandit_action` function with a `bandit_action` dictionary containing the following fields:

<ApiOptionRef 
  name="timestamp"
  type="str"
  defaultValue="undefined"
>

The time when the action is taken in UTC. Example: `"2024-03-22T14:26:55.000Z"`
</ApiOptionRef>

<ApiOptionRef 
  name="flagKey"
  type="str"
  defaultValue="undefined"
>

The key of the feature flag corresponding to the bandit. Example: `"bandit-test-allocation-4"`
</ApiOptionRef>

<ApiOptionRef 
  name="banditKey"
  type="str"
  defaultValue="undefined"
>

The key (unique identifier) of the bandit. Example: `"ad-bandit-1"`
</ApiOptionRef>

<ApiOptionRef 
  name="subject"
  type="str"
  defaultValue="undefined"
>

An identifier of the subject or user assigned to the experiment variation. Example: `"ed6f85019080"`
</ApiOptionRef>

<ApiOptionRef 
  name="subjectNumericAttributes"
  type="Dict[str, float]"
  defaultValue="{}"
>

Metadata about numeric attributes of the subject. Example: `{"age": 30}`
</ApiOptionRef>

<ApiOptionRef 
  name="subjectCategoricalAttributes"
  type="Dict[str, str]"
  defaultValue="{}"
>

Metadata about non-numeric attributes of the subject. Example: `{"loyalty_tier": "gold"}`
</ApiOptionRef>

<ApiOptionRef 
  name="action"
  type="str"
  defaultValue="undefined"
>

The action assigned by the bandit. Example: `"promo-20%-off"`
</ApiOptionRef>

<ApiOptionRef 
  name="actionNumericAttributes"
  type="Dict[str, float]"
  defaultValue="{}"
>

Metadata about numeric attributes of the assigned action. Example: `{"brandAffinity": 0.2}`
</ApiOptionRef>

<ApiOptionRef 
  name="actionCategoricalAttributes"
  type="Dict[str, str]"
  defaultValue="{}"
>

Metadata about non-numeric attributes of the assigned action. Example: `{"previouslyPurchased": "false"}`
</ApiOptionRef>

<ApiOptionRef 
  name="actionProbability"
  type="float"
  defaultValue="undefined"
>

The weight between 0 and 1 the bandit valued the assigned action. Example: `0.25`
</ApiOptionRef>

<ApiOptionRef 
  name="modelVersion"
  type="str"
  defaultValue="undefined"
>

Unique identifier for the version of the bandit parameters used. Example: `"v123"`
</ApiOptionRef>

## Querying the Bandit

To query the bandit for an action, use the `get_bandit_action` function:

```python
import eppo_client
from eppo_client import ContextAttributes

client = eppo_client.get_instance()
bandit_result = client.get_bandit_action(
    "shoe-bandit",  # flag_key
    user.id,        # subject_key
    ContextAttributes(     # subject_attributes
        numeric_attributes={"age": 25},
        categorical_attributes={"country": "GB"}
    ),
    {              # actions with their attributes
        "nike": ContextAttributes(
            numeric_attributes={"brand_affinity": 2.3},
            categorical_attributes={"previously_purchased": True},
        ),
        "adidas": ContextAttributes(
            numeric_attributes={"brand_affinity": 0.2},
            categorical_attributes={"previously_purchased": False},
        ),
    },
    "control"      # default_value
)

if bandit_result.action:
    show_shoe_ad(bandit_result.action)
else:
    show_default_ad()
```

### Subject Context

The subject context contains contextual information about the subject that is independent of bandit actions.
For example, the subject's age or country.

The subject context has type `ContextAttributes` which has two fields:
- `numeric_attributes` (Dict[str, float]): A dictionary of numeric attributes (such as "age")
- `categorical_attributes` (Dict[str, str]): A dictionary of categorical attributes (such as "country")

:::note
The `ContextAttributes` are also used for targeting rules for the feature flag similar to how `subject_attributes` are used with regular feature flags.
:::

### Action Contexts

Next, supply a dictionary with actions and their attributes: `actions: Dict[str, ContextAttributes]`.
If the user is assigned to the bandit, the bandit selects one of the actions supplied here.
All actions supplied are considered to be valid; if an action should not be shown to a user, do not include it in this dictionary.

The action attributes are similar to the `subject_attributes` but hold action-specific information.
You can use `ContextAttributes.empty()` to create an empty attribute context.

Note that relevant action contexts are subject-action interactions. For example, there could be a "brand-affinity" model
that computes brand affinities of users to brands, and scores of that model can be added to the action context to provide
additional context for the bandit.

### Result

The `bandit_result` is an instance of `EvaluationResult`, which has two fields:
- `variation` (str): The variation that was assigned to the subject
- `action` (Optional[str]): The action that was assigned to the subject

The variation returns the feature flag variation, this can be the bandit itself, or the "status quo" variation if the user is not assigned to the bandit.
If we are unable to generate a variation, for example when the flag is turned off, then the `default` variation is returned.
In both of those cases, the `action` is `None`, and you should use the status-quo algorithm to select an action.

When `action` is not `None`, the bandit has selected that action to be shown to the user.

### Status Quo Algorithm

In order to accurately measure the performance of the bandit, we need to compare it to the status quo algorithm using an experiment.
This status quo algorithm could be a complicated algorithm that selects an action according to a different model, or a simple baseline such as selecting a fixed or random action.

When you create an analysis allocation for the bandit and the `action` in `EvaluationResult` is `None`, implement the desired status quo algorithm based on the `variation` value.

## Debugging

You may encounter a situation where a bandit assignment produces a value that you did not expect. The SDK provides detailed evaluation information through the `get_bandit_action_details()` method:

```python
evaluation = client.get_bandit_action_details(
    "shoe-bandit",
    "test-subject",
    subject_attributes,
    actions,
    "control"
)

print("Assignment:", evaluation.variation)
print("Action:", evaluation.action)
print("Details:", evaluation.evaluation_details)
```
