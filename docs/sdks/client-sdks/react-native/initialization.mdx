The Eppo JavaScript SDK is easy to initialize while offering robust customization options, making it adaptable to various use cases such as offline mode, custom caching requirements, and ultra-low-latency initialization.

## Initialize the SDK

To complete basic initialization, you only need to provide an SDK key. [Create an SDK key](/sdks/sdk-keys) if you don't already have one. 

```javascript
import { init } from "@eppo/react-native-sdk";

await init({
  apiKey: 'tx6eTRdJh2MD0KV87FB2aQ1uNMhGpzJmucQRifMtvGE',
  assignmentLogger: { logAssignment: (assignment: IAssignmentEvent)=> console.log('TODO: send to warehouse', assignment) }
})
``` 

## Use the SDK instance
After initialization, you can use the SDK instance by importing the SDK at the scope you will use it in and calling `getInstance()`. You can then use the SDK instance to assign a variation to a subject using the `get*Assignment` functions.

```javascript
import * as EppoSdk from "@eppo/react-native-sdk";

const eppoClient = EppoSdk.getInstance();
const user = user?.id || "anonymous";

```


## Advanced Configuration
Basic initialization is great for most use cases, but the SDK provides options that you can use during initialization to customize the behavior of the SDK.

### Initialization Options

How the SDK fetches, serves, and caches experiment configurations is configurable via additional optional initialization options:

<ApiOptionRef 
  name="requestTimeoutMs"
  type="number"
  defaultValue="5000"
>

**Timeout** in milliseconds for HTTPS requests for the experiment configurations.
</ApiOptionRef>

<ApiOptionRef 
  name="numInitialRequestRetries"
  type="number"
  defaultValue="1"
>

Number of *additional* times the initial configurations request will be attempted if it fails. 
This is the request typically synchronously waited (via `await`) for completion. 
A small wait will be done between requests.
</ApiOptionRef>

<ApiOptionRef 
  name="baseUrl"
  type="string"
  defaultValue="https://api.eppo.com"
>

The base URL for for the API. Can be overriden to proxy configuration requests.
</ApiOptionRef>


<ApiOptionRef 
  name="pollAfterFailedInitialization"
  type="boolean"
  defaultValue="false"
>

Poll for new configurations even if the initial configurations request failed.
</ApiOptionRef>

<ApiOptionRef 
  name="throwOnFailedInitialization"
  type="boolean"
  defaultValue="true"
>

Throw an error (reject the promise) if unable to fetch initial configurations during initialization.
</ApiOptionRef>

<ApiOptionRef 
  name="numPollRequestRetries"
  type="number"
  defaultValue="7"
>

If polling for updated configurations after initialization, the number of additional times a request will be attempted before giving up. Subsequent attempts are done using an exponential backoff.
</ApiOptionRef>

<ApiOptionRef 
  name="persistentStore"
  type="IAsyncStore"
  defaultValue="(Eppo provided)"
>

An asynchronous, persistent storage for caching fetched flag configurations for use in subsequent sessions
</ApiOptionRef>

<ApiOptionRef 
  name="maxCacheAgeSeconds"
  type="number"
  defaultValue="0"
>

Maximum age, in seconds, that a previously cached configuration is considered valid and the wait-time before fetching a fresh configuration
</ApiOptionRef>
