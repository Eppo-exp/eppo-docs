The Eppo JavaScript SDK enables feature flags and experiments in your JavaScript applications with only a few lines of code.

The SDK handles all the complexity of feature flag evaluation and experiment assignment locally in your application, with no network calls required after initial setup. This guide will walk you through installing the SDK and implementing your first feature flag, experiment, and contextual bandit.

## Installation

First, install the SDK into your current project.

The Eppo JavaScript SDK is available via a number of package managers or via a CDN. Use whichever one you prefer.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="yarn" label="Yarn">

```bash
yarn add @eppo/js-client-sdk
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="npm" label="NPM">

```bash
npm install @eppo/js-client-sdk
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="bun" label="Bun">

```bash
bun add @eppo/js-client-sdk
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="script" label="Script">

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@eppo/js-client-sdk@latest/dist/eppo-sdk.min.js"></script>
```

If you install via a `<script>` tag, include a version in the URL to install a specific version of the SDK (or use `latest` as the version to install the latest SDK version):

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@eppo/js-client-sdk@{version}/dist/eppo-sdk.min.js"></script>
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


Depending on whether you are running a feature flag, an experiment, or a bandit, the initialization code will be slightly different.

## Feature Flags
Feature flags are a way to toggle features on and off without needing to deploy code.

### Initialize the SDK

[Create an SDK key](/sdks/sdk-key) if you don't already have one. 

First, initialize the SDK using your SDK key. The SDK key is different from the project API key. 


```js
import Eppo from "@eppo/js-client-sdk";

const eppo = new Eppo({
  apiKey: 'YOUR_SDK_KEY',
});
``` 

:::note
The SDK key is different from the project API key. You can find your SDK key in the [SDK Keys section of the Eppo interface](https://eppo.cloud/configuration/environments/keys).
:::

### Assign a variant

Once the SDK is initialized, it will live as a singleton instance that you can access and use to make assignments anywhere in your app. Make an assignment by importing the SDK and calling the `.getInstance()` method. After that, you will want to use a function to get a user identifier from the current user session.
  
```javascript
import * as EppoSdk from "@eppo/js-client-sdk";

// Created the client instance
const eppoClient = EppoSdk.getInstance();

// Get the current user information
const user = getCurrentUser();

// Make an assignment
const variation = eppoClient.getBooleanAssignment(
  'show-new-feature', // feature flag key
  user.id, // subject key
  { 
    // userProperties
    'country': user.country,
    'device': user.device,
  }, 
  false, //default value
);

// Render the appropriate component based on the assignment
return variation ? <new_variant /> : <old_variant />
```

That's all the code you need to make a basic assignment. After that, you can do the rest of the work running the experiment from the Eppo UI. This is awesome both because it allows you to iterate quickly and because it gives you the ability to change the experiment configuration without redeploying your code.

You can see the full steps for setting up a feature flag including UI steps in the [feature flag quickstart](/feature-flag-quickstart).


## Experiments

While feature flags are useful, they do not send you any information about how your users are interacting with the feature. Experiments provide a way to collect data about these interactions using the same event logging system that you 

To log events through the SDK, you need to define a `logAssignment()` function using the `IAssignmentLogger` interface to pass to the `init()` function.

For simplicity, we'll create a `logAssignment()` function that logs the assignment data to the console.

```javascript
// Import Eppo's assignment logger interface and client initializer
import { IAssignmentLogger, init } from "@eppo/js-client-sdk";

// Define logAssignment so that it logs events
const assignmentLogger: IAssignmentLogger = {
  logAssignment(assignment) {
    console.log(assignment);
  }
};

// Initialize the SDK
await init({
  apiKey: "<SDK_KEY>",
  assignmentLogger,
});

```


:::note
In a production application, you would want to replace the `console.log()` statement with an actual logging system. We have documentation on how to set up logging with multiple popular data warehouses and logging systems in the [Assignment page](/sdks/client-sdks/javascript/assignments/#logging-data-to-your-data-warehouse).
:::

### Assign a variant

After initializing the SDK with the `logAssignment()` function, you can make assignments in the same way you can for feature flags.

```js
// Get the current user information
const user = getCurrentUser();

// Make an assignment
const variation = eppoClient.getBooleanAssignment(
  'show-new-feature', // feature flag key
  user.id, // subject key
  { 
    // userProperties
    'country': user.country,
    'device': user.device,
  }, 
  false, //default value
);
```
