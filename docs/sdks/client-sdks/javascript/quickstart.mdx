The Eppo JavaScript SDK enables feature flags and experiments in your JavaScript applications with only a few lines of code.

The SDK handles all the complexity of feature flag evaluation and experiment assignment locally in your application, with no network calls required after initial setup. This guide will walk you through installing the SDK and implementing your first feature flag.

## Installation

First, install the SDK into your current project.

The Eppo JavaScript SDK is available via a number of package managers or via a CDN. Use whichever one you prefer.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="yarn" label="Yarn">

```bash
yarn add @eppo/js-client-sdk
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="npm" label="NPM">

```bash
npm install @eppo/js-client-sdk
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="bun" label="Bun">

```bash
bun add @eppo/js-client-sdk
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="script" label="Script">

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@eppo/js-client-sdk@latest/dist/eppo-sdk.min.js"></script>
```

If you install via a `<script>` tag, include a version in the URL to install a specific version of the SDK (or use `latest` as the version to install the latest SDK version):

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@eppo/js-client-sdk@{version}/dist/eppo-sdk.min.js"></script>
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Initialize the SDK

[Create an SDK key](/sdks/sdk-key) if you don't already have one. 

First, initialize the SDK using your SDK key. The SDK key is different from the project API key. 


```js
import Eppo from "@eppo/js-client-sdk";

const eppo = new Eppo({
  apiKey: 'YOUR_SDK_KEY',
});
``` 

:::note
The SDK key is different from the project API key. You can find your SDK key in the [SDK Keys section of the Eppo interface](https://eppo.cloud/configuration/environments/keys).

## Assign a variant

Once the SDK is initialized, it will live as a singleton instance that you can access and use to make assignments anywhere in your app. Make an assignment by importing the SDK and calling the `.getInstance()` method. After that, you will want to use a function to get a user identifier from the current user session.
  
```javascript
import * as EppoSdk from "@eppo/js-client-sdk";

// Created the client instance
const eppoClient = EppoSdk.getInstance();

// Get the current user information
const user = getCurrentUser();

// Make an assignment
const variation = eppoClient.getBooleanAssignment(
  'show-new-feature', // feature flag key
  user.id, // subject key
  { 
    // userProperties
    'country': user.country,
    'device': user.device,
  }, 
  false, //default value
);

// Render the appropriate component based on the assignment
return variation ? <new_variant /> : <old_variant />
```

That's all the code you need to make a basic assignment. After that, you can do the rest of the work running the experiment from the Eppo UI. This is awesome both because it allows you to iterate quickly and because it gives you the ability to change the experiment configuration without redeploying your code.

You can see the full steps for running an experiment including UI steps in the [feature flag quickstart](/quick-starts/feature-flag-quickstart).
