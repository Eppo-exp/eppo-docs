The Eppo JavaScript SDK enables feature flags and experiments in your JavaScript applications with only a few lines of code.

The SDK handles all the complexity of feature flag evaluation and experiment assignment locally in your application, with no network calls required after initial setup. This guide will walk you through installing the SDK and implementing your first feature flag, experiment, and contextual bandit.

## Installation

First, install the SDK into your current project.

The Eppo JavaScript SDK is available via a number of package managers or via a CDN. Use whichever one you prefer.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="yarn" label="Yarn">

```bash
yarn add @eppo/js-client-sdk
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="npm" label="NPM">

```bash
npm install @eppo/js-client-sdk
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="bun" label="Bun">

```bash
bun add @eppo/js-client-sdk
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="script" label="Script">

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@eppo/js-client-sdk@latest/dist/eppo-sdk.min.js"></script>
```

If you install via a `<script>` tag, include a version in the URL to install a specific version of the SDK (or use `latest` as the version to install the latest SDK version):

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@eppo/js-client-sdk@{version}/dist/eppo-sdk.min.js"></script>
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


Depending on whether you are running a feature flag, an experiment, or a bandit, the initialization code will be slightly different.

## Feature Flags
Feature flags are a way to toggle features on and off without needing to deploy code.

### Initialize the SDK

[Create an SDK key](/sdks/sdk-keys) if you don't already have one.

First, initialize the SDK using your SDK key. The SDK key is different from the project API key.


```js
import init from "@eppo/js-client-sdk";

await init({
  apiKey: "SDK_KEY",
  assignmentLogger: { logAssignment: (assignmentEvent) => console.log('Send to warehouse: ', assignmentEvent) },
});
```

:::note
The SDK key is different from the project API key. You can find your SDK key in the [SDK Keys section of the Eppo interface](https://eppo.cloud/configuration/environments/keys).
:::

### Assign a variant

Once initialized, the SDK uses a singleton pattern, making it accessible from anywhere in your application. To make assignments, import the SDK and use `getInstance()` to access the SDK instance.

### How assignments work

The SDK periodically retrieves configuration rules from the Eppo server that define how subjects should be allocated to variants. When you call an assignment function, the SDK evaluates these rules locally without making additional network requests.

Each assignment requires:

- **Flag Key**: Identifies which set of configuration rules to use
- **Subject Key**: A unique identifier for the subject (usually a user ID)
- **Subject Attributes**: Optional key-value pairs containing additional information used for rule evaluation
- **Default Value**: Fallback value if assignment fails or rules don't match

```js
import * as EppoSdk from "@eppo/js-client-sdk";

// Get SDK instance
const eppoClient = EppoSdk.getInstance();

// Define assignment parameters
const featureKey = "my-neat-feature";
const subjectKey = getCurrentUser() || "anonymous";
const subjectAttributes = {
    'country': user.country,
    'device': user.device,
};
const defaultValue = "default-value";

// Make an assignment
const variation = eppoClient.getStringAssignment(
  featureKey,
  subjectKey,
  subjectAttributes,
  defaultValue
);
```

### Assignment Types

The SDK provides different assignment functions based on the type of value you need:

| Function | Return Type |
|----------|-------------|
| `getStringAssignment()` | String |
| `getBooleanAssignment()` | Boolean |
| `getJSONAssignment()` | JSON object |
| `getIntegerAssignment()` | Integer |
| `getNumericAssignment()` | Float |

:::note
See more details about assignment functions in the [Assignments](/sdks/client-sdks/javascript/assignments) page.
:::

### Using Assignments

After receiving an assignment, your application should implement logic to modify the user experience accordingly:

```javascript
// Example using a boolean assignment
const variation = eppoClient.getStringAssignment(
  featureKey,
  subjectKey,
  subjectAttributes,
  defaultValue
);

// Render different components based on assignment
if (variation === "landing-page-a") {
    return <LandingPageA />
} else if (variation === "landing-page-b") {
    return <LandingPageB />
} else {
    return <LandingPageC />
}
```

That's all the code you need to make a basic assignment. After that, you can do the rest of the work running the experiment from the Eppo UI. This is awesome both because it allows you to iterate quickly and because it gives you the ability to change the experiment configuration without redeploying your code.

You can see the full steps for setting up a feature flag including UI steps in the [feature flag quickstart](/feature-flag-quickstart).

## Event Tracking

While feature flags are useful, by themselves they do not allow you to understand how your users are using your product. Eppo's [Event Tracking](/event-logging/event-tracking) APIs allow you to track any event/action which will be sent to your data warehouse. Those events can then be used to create metrics in Eppo which can then be analyzed with experiments.

Tracking events involves providing a `type`, as well a `payload` containing any additional fields you want to associate with the event. Common values you may want to include are user ID, device language, and/or user agent.

```typescript
import * as EppoSdk from "@eppo/js-client-sdk";

const eppoClient = EppoSdk.getInstance();
eppoClient.track({
  type: "added_to_cart",
  payload: {
    userId: 1337,
    language: "en-US"
    productId: "product-xyz",
    price: 24.99,
    currency: "USD",
  }
});
```


## Experiments
Running experiments in Eppo requires tables in your warehouse indicating which users/subjects were assigned to which variation.

To log events through the SDK, you need to define a `logAssignment()` function using the `IAssignmentLogger` interface to pass to the `init()` function.

For simplicity, we'll create a `logAssignment()` function that logs the assignment data to the console.

```javascript
// Import Eppo's assignment logger interface and client initializer
import { IAssignmentLogger, init } from "@eppo/js-client-sdk";

// Define logAssignment so that it logs events
const assignmentLogger: IAssignmentLogger = {
  logAssignment(assignment) {
    console.log(assignment);
  }
};

// Initialize the SDK
await init({
  apiKey: "<SDK_KEY>",
  assignmentLogger,
});

```


:::note
In a production application, you would want to replace the `console.log()` statement with an actual logging system. We have documentation on how to set up logging with multiple popular data warehouses and logging systems in the [Assignment page](/sdks/client-sdks/javascript/assignments/#logging-data-to-your-data-warehouse).
:::

### Assign a variant

After initializing the SDK with the `logAssignment()` function, you can make assignments in the same way as for feature flags.

```js
import * as EppoSdk from "@eppo/js-client-sdk";

// Get SDK instance
const eppoClient = EppoSdk.getInstance();

// Define assignment parameters
const featureKey = "my-neat-feature";
const subjectKey = getCurrentUser() || "anonymous";
const subjectAttributes = {
    'country': user.country,
    'device': user.device,
};
const defaultValue = "default-value";

// Make an assignment
const variation = eppoClient.getStringAssignment(
  featureKey,
  subjectKey,
  subjectAttributes,
  defaultValue
);

if (variation === "landing-page-a") {
    return <LandingPageA />
} else if (variation === "landing-page-b") {
    return <LandingPageB />
} else {
    return <LandingPageC />
}
```

You can see the full steps for running an experiment including UI steps in the [experiment quick start](/experiment-allocation-quickstart/).


## Contextual Bandits

Contextual Multi-Armed Bandits are a way to dynamically optimize assignments based on user context. A bandit balances exploration of new actions with exploitation of known successful actions to maximize a specified metric.

### Bandit Setup

Setting up a bandit is very similar to setting up an experiment but with an additional logging function.

```js
// Import Eppo's logger interfaces and client initializer
import { IAssignmentLogger, IBanditLogger, init } from "@eppo/node-server-sdk";

// Define an assignment logger for recording variation assignments
const assignmentLogger: IAssignmentLogger = {
  logAssignment(assignment: IAssignmentEvent) {
    console.log("TODO: save assignment information to data warehouse", assignment);
  }
};

// Define a bandit logger for recording bandit action assignments
const banditLogger: IBanditLogger = {
  logBanditAction (banditEvent: IBanditEvent) {
    console.log("TODO: save bandit action information to the data warehouse, ensuring the column names are as expected", banditEvent);
  }
};

// Initialize the SDK with both loggers provided
await init({
  apiKey: "<SDK_KEY>",
  assignmentLogger,
  banditLogger
});
```

:::note
In a production application, you would want to replace the `console.log()` statement with an actual logging system. We have documentation on how to set up logging with multiple popular data warehouses and logging systems in the [Assignment page](/sdks/client-sdks/javascript/assignments/#logging-data-to-your-data-warehouse).
:::

### Query the bandit for actions

Instead of making simple assignments with a bandit, you will want to query the bandit for actions.

```js
import * as EppoSdk from "@eppo/js-client-sdk";
import { Attributes, BanditActions } from "@eppo/js-client-sdk-common";

const eppoClient = EppoSdk.getInstance();

const flagKey = "shoe-bandit";
const subjectKey = getCurrentUser() || "anonymous";
const subjectAttributes: Attributes = { age: 25, country: "GB" };
const defaultValue = "default";
const actions: BanditActions = {
  nike: {
    numericAttributes: { brandAffinity: 2.3 },
    categoricalAttributes: { imageAspectRatio: "16:9" }
  },
  adidas: {
    numericAttributes: { brandAffinity: 0.2 },
    categoricalAttributes: { imageAspectRatio: "16:9" }
  }
};



const { variation, action } = eppoClient.getBanditAction(
  flagKey,
  subjectKey,
  subjectAttributes,
  actions,
  defaultValue
);

if (action) {
  renderShoeAd(action);
} else {
  renderDefaultShoeAd();
}
```
