## Usage with Contextual Multi-Armed Bandits

Eppo also supports contextual multi-armed bandits. You can read more about them in the [high-level documentation](/contextual-bandits).
Bandit flag configuration--including setting up the flag key, status quo variation, bandit variation, and targeting rules--are configured within
the Eppo application.

To leverage bandits using the JavaScript Client SDK, there are two additional steps over regular feature flags:
1. Add a bandit action logger to the SDK client instance
2. Provide the SDK the available actions for the bandit

Bandits can only be used with [precomputed assignments](../precomputed-assignments).

```ts
await EppoSdk.precomputedInit({
    apiKey: 'YOUR_SDK_KEY',
    assignmentLogger: {
        logAssignment: (assignmentEvent) => {
            /* send to warehouse */
        }
    },
    banditLogger: {
        logBanditAction: (banditEvent) => {
            /* send to warehouse */
        }
    },
    precompute: {
        subjectKey: 'test-subject',
        subjectAttributes: { attr1: 'value1' },
        banditActions: {
            'bandit1-key': {
                'action1-key': {
                    numericAttributes: { subjectActionNumericAttr1: 12345 },
                    categoricalAttributes: { subjectActionCategoricalAttr1: 'value1' }
                },
                'action2-key': { numericAttributes: {}, categoricalAttributes: {} },
                'action3-key': { numericAttributes: {}, categoricalAttributes: {} },
                'action4-key': { numericAttributes: {}, categoricalAttributes: {} }
            }
        }
    }
});
```

The SDK will invoke the `logBanditAction()` function with an `IBanditEvent` object that contains the following fields:

### Querying the bandit for an action

To query the bandit for an action, you can use the `getBanditAction()` function. This function takes the following parameters:
- `flagKey` (string): The key of the feature flag corresponding to the bandit
- `defaultValue` (string): The default *variation* to return if the flag is not successfully evaluated

The following code queries the bandit for an action:

```ts
const banditResult = EppoSdk.getPrecomputedInstance().getBanditAction('bandit1-key', 'bandit1-default');
const variant = banditResult.variant;
const action = banditResult.action;
```

#### Subject context

The subject context contains contextual information about the subject that is independent of bandit actions.
For example, the subject's age or country.

The subject context can be provided as `Attributes`, which will then assume anything that is number is a numeric
attribute, and everything else is a categorical attribute.

You can also explicitly bucket the attribute types by providing the context as `ContextAttributes`. For example, you may have an attribute named `priority`, with
possible values `0`, `1`, and `2` that you want to be treated categorically rather than numeric. `ContextAttributes` have two nested sets of attributes:
- `numericAttributes` (Attributes): A mapping of attribute names to their numeric values (e.g., `age: 30`)
- `categoricalAttributes` (Attributes): A mapping of attribute names to their categorical values (e.g., `country`)

Any non-numeric values explicitly passed in as values for numeric attributes will be ignored.

Attribute names and values are case-sensitive.

:::note
The subject context, passed in as the `subjectAttributes` parameter, is also still used for targeting rules for the feature flag,
just like with non-bandit assignment methods.
:::

#### Action contexts

The action context contains contextual information about each action. They can be provided as a mapping of attribute names
to their contexts.

Action contexts must be provided as `ContextAttributes`, which have explicit bucketing into `numericAttributes`
and `categoricalAttributes`.

Note that relevant action contexts are subject-action interactions. For example, there could be a "brand-affinity" model
that computes brand affinities of users to brands, and scores of that model can be added to the action context to provide
additional context for the bandit.

If the subject is assigned to the variation associated with the bandit, the bandit selects one of the supplied actions.
All actions supplied are considered to be valid. If an action should not be available to a subject, do not include it in initialization.

Like attributes, actions and their attributes are case-sensitive.

#### Result

`getBanditAction()` returns two fields:
- `variation` (string): The variation that was assigned to the subject
- `action` (string | null): The action that was assigned to the subject by the bandit, or `null` if the bandit was not assigned

The variation returns the feature flag variation. This can be the bandit itself, or the "status quo" variation if the subject is not assigned to the bandit.

If we are unable to generate a variation, for example when the flag is turned off, then the provided `default` variation is returned.
In both of those cases, the returned `action` will be `null`, and you should use the status-quo algorithm to select an action (more on this below).

When `action` is not `null`, the bandit has selected an action for the subject.

:::note
If no actions are provided and the flag still has an active bandit, if the bandit variation is assigned the assigned
action will be `null`.
:::

:::note
If the flag no longer has any allocations with bandits, this function will behave the same as `getStringAssignment()`, with
the provided actions being ignored and the assigned variation being returned along with a `null` action.
:::

#### Status quo algorithm

In order to accurately measure the performance of the bandit, we need to compare it to the status quo algorithm using an experiment.
This status quo algorithm could be a complicated algorithm to that selects an action according to a different model, or a simple baseline such as selecting a fixed or random action.
When you create an analysis allocation for the bandit and the returned `action` is `null`, implement the desired status quo algorithm based on the `variation` value.

## Debugging

You may encounter a situation where a flag assignment produces a value that you did not expect. There are functions [detailed here](/sdks/sdk-features/debugging-flag-assignment/) to help you understand how flags are assigned, which will allow you to take corrective action on potential configuration issues.
