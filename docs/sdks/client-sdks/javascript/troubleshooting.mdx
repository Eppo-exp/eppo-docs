## Debugging

You may encounter a situation where a flag assignment produces a value that you did not expect. There are functions [detailed here](/sdks/sdk-features/debugging-flag-assignment) to help you understand how flags are assigned, which will allow you to take corrective action on potential configuration issues. 

## Supporting old browsers

The SDK is supported on all modern browsers. It relies on JavaScript promises, which may not be supported on older browsers including IE. If you need to run the SDK on a browser that does not support promises, it is possible to use a [polyfill library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/promise-polyfill).
