## Overview

In certain situations, you may wish to hold off on logging assignments until a later time, such as the user granting
the relevant permission.

To handle this, you can initialize the SDK without an assignment logger and let it buffer events to be flushed later
when permission has been granted.

With no initial assignment logger, the SDK will buffer 10,000 events in memory, and will flush them when an assignment
logger is later defined.

## Code Example

First, you want to initialize the SDK _without_ an assignment logger. We leverage TypeScript's typing to remind people to
specify an assignment logger, so you will need to explicitly cast `null` in order to pass in while satisfying type
checks.

```ts
await init({
  apiKey: 'YOUR_SDK_KEY',
  assignmentLogger: null as unknown as IAssignmentLogger,
});
```

Once you are ready to send the buffered events, set the assignment logger.

```ts
getInstance().setAssignmentLogger({
  logAssignment(assignment: IAssignmentEvent) {
    console.log('Send to warehouse: ', assignmentEvent);
  }
});
```

Note that since assignments are buffered in memory, if the SDK is reinitialized any buffered assignments will be reset.
