Introduce the high level concepts of a feature for the SDK. Include links to the relevant conceptual sections in the docs and references if it makes sense.


## Basic feature use
Walk through the process of using the feature. Put the most common use case first. Have code samples for everything that involves code. Link to references if they are available and make sense to include.

## Advanced feature use
Go off the beaten path. Start by presenting reference material, tables, config, and complex use cases. Add code samples where appropriate.
