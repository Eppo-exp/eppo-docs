## Overview

Precomputed assignments is a feature that allows you to receive assignments for all flags for a given user.

The computation happens with a remote call to an Eppo Edge Function which is globally distributed to be as close to the user as possible. 
Availability is backed by Eppo's global CDN.

The new SDK methods are available in Eppo's Javascript SDK version `3.8.0` and above.

## Advantages

- Private and secure handling of targeting rules.
- High availability and low latency due to global distribution with the CDN.

## Assignment logging

During classic flag evaluation, the SDK executes the user provided logging callback if one is defined
when a variation is matched.

For precomputed assignments, evaluation and exposure are separated.
Evaluation happens when the assignments are fetched. Exposure happens when the assignments are used. 
The execution of `getAssignment` triggers exposure logging.

## Initialize precomputed client

```
import * as EppoSdk from "@eppo/js-client-sdk";

const client = await EppoSdk.precomputedInit({
    apiKey: 'dummy',
    assignmentLogger: mockLogger,
    subjectKey: 'test-subject',
    subjectAttributes: { attr1: 'value1' },
});

const variant = client.getStringAssignment(flagKey, 'default-value');
```
