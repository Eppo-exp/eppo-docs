The Eppo JavaScript SDK is easy to initialize while offering robust customization options, making it adaptable to various use cases such as offline mode, custom caching requirements, and ultra-low-latency initialization.

## Initialize the SDK

To complete basic initialization, you only need to provide an SDK key. [Create an SDK key](/sdks/sdk-keys) if you don't already have one. 

```javascript
import { init } from "@eppo/js-client-sdk";

await init({
  apiKey: "YOUR_SDK_KEY",
  assignmentLogger: { logAssignment: (assignmentEvent) => console.log('Send to warehouse: ', assignmentEvent) },

});
``` 

## Use the SDK instance

After initialization, you can use the SDK instance by importing the SDK at the scope you will use it in and calling `getInstance()`. You can then use the SDK instance to assign a variation to a subject using the `get*Assignment` functions.

```javascript
import * as EppoSdk from "@eppo/js-client-sdk";

const eppoClient = EppoSdk.getInstance();
const user = getCurrentUser();

```


## Advanced Configuration
Basic initialization is great for most use cases, but the SDK provides options that you can use during initialization to customize the behavior of the SDK.

### Initialization Options

How the SDK fetches, serves, and caches experiment configurations is configurable via additional optional initialization options:

<ApiOptionRef 
  name="requestTimeoutMs"
  type="number"
  defaultValue="5000"
>

**Timeout** in milliseconds for HTTPS requests for the experiment configurations.
</ApiOptionRef>

<ApiOptionRef 
  name="numInitialRequestRetries"
  type="number"
  defaultValue="1"
>

Number of *additional* times the initial configurations request will be attempted if it fails. 
This is the request typically synchronously waited (via `await`) for completion. 
A small wait will be done between requests.
</ApiOptionRef>

<ApiOptionRef 
  name="pollAfterSuccessfulInitialization"
  type="boolean"
  defaultValue="false"
>

Poll for new **configurations** (every 30 seconds) after successfully requesting the initial configurations.
</ApiOptionRef>

<ApiOptionRef 
  name="pollAfterFailedInitialization"
  type="boolean"
  defaultValue="false"
>

Poll for new configurations even if the initial configurations request failed.
</ApiOptionRef>

<ApiOptionRef 
  name="throwOnFailedInitialization"
  type="boolean"
  defaultValue="true"
>

Throw an error (reject the promise) if unable to fetch initial configurations during initialization.
</ApiOptionRef>

<ApiOptionRef 
  name="numPollRequestRetries"
  type="number"
  defaultValue="7"
>

If polling for updated configurations after initialization, the number of additional times a request will be attempted before giving up. Subsequent attempts are done using an exponential backoff.
</ApiOptionRef>

<ApiOptionRef 
  name="skipInitialRequest"
  type="boolean"
  defaultValue="false"
>

Skip the initial request for a new configuration during initialization (if polling is enabled, this will still take place later)
</ApiOptionRef>

<ApiOptionRef 
  name="persistentStore"
  type="IAsyncStore"
  defaultValue="Eppo provided"
>

An asynchronous, persistent storage for caching fetched flag configurations for use in subsequent sessions
</ApiOptionRef>

<ApiOptionRef 
  name="maxCacheAgeSeconds"
  type="number"
  defaultValue="0"
>

Maximum age, in seconds, that a previously cached configuration is considered valid and the wait-time before fetching a fresh configuration
</ApiOptionRef>

<ApiOptionRef 
  name="useExpiredCache"
  type="boolean"
  defaultValue="false"
>

Consider initialization successfully complete without fetching updates, even if the configuration loaded from the cache is expired
</ApiOptionRef>

<ApiOptionRef 
  name="updateOnFetch"
  type="'always' | 'expired' | 'empty'"
  defaultValue="'always'"
>

Sets how the configuration is updated after a successful fetch:

  - **always** - immediately start using the new configuration
  - **expired** - immediately start using the new configuration only if the current one has expired
  - **empty** - only use the new configuration if the current one is both expired and uninitialized/empty

</ApiOptionRef>

### Configuration caching
The SDK can cache previously loaded configurations for use in future sessions. 
This makes the SDK initialize faster.

By default, a Local Storage-based cache is used in a browser environment and a Chrome Storage-based cache is used in a Chrome extension environment.
A custom cache can be provided as the `persistentStore` initialization option.

#### Why cache configurations?
Caching experiment configurations locally improves your application by making it faster and giving it a fallback value when network requests fail.

#### How configuration Caching Works
The SDK automatically caches configurations using:
- Local Storage in browser environments
- Chrome Storage in extension environments

You can also implement your own custom cache by providing a `persistentStore`:

```javascript
import { init } from "@eppo/js-client-sdk";

await init({
  apiKey: 'YOUR_SDK_KEY',
  persistentStore: myCustomStore
});
```

#### Expiration
Caching settings depend on the concept of expiration. Expiration is controlled by the `maxCacheAgeSeconds` initialization option. This setting is overridable by the implementation of `isExpired()` for a custom persistent store.

When the cached configuration is not expired, it is considered valid and no fetches will be made for updated configurations.


#### Example configuration options
There are a few common configurations that you might want to use depending on what type of performance and consistency characteristics you want for your application.

##### Prioritize flag value freshness
If you want to always using the latest flag values, you'd want settings that:
- Consider anything cached expired
- Do not use expired cached configurations
- Immediately start using the new configuration after it is fetched
- Do not retry a failed initialization fetch

Use the following configuration to achieve this:

```ts
import { init } from "@eppo/js-client-sdk";

await init({
  apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
  maxCacheAgeSeconds: 0, // Always consider cached configurations expired
  useExpiredCache: false, // Wait for an updated configuration to be fetched before initialization is considered successful
  updateOnFetch: 'always', // Immediately start using the new configuration after it is fetched
  requestTimeoutMs: 5000, // Don't time out the initial configuration request until five seconds have passed
  numInitialRequestRetries: 1, // If the initial configuration request fails, try one more time 
  pollAfterSuccessfulInitialization: true, // Check for updated configurations every 30 seconds
  pollAfterFailedInitialization: false, // Check for updated configurations even if initialization wasn't able to load one
});
```
This configuration ensures the SDK will use the lastest assignment values immediately but may be slower to initialize than other approaches.

###### Prioritize fast initialization
If you want to optimize for the quickest time to initialization and serving assignments--even if those assignments may be out of date, you would want settings that:
- Immediately start using the new configuration after it is fetched
- Allow initializing with older configurations
- Reduce the initial fetch timeout and retries to quickly fall back to default values

Use the following configuration to achieve those goals:

```ts
import { init } from "@eppo/js-client-sdk";

await init({
  apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
  updateOnFetch: 'always', // Immediately start using the new configuration once it is fetched
  maxCacheAgeSeconds: 300, // Don't even bother fetching updated configurations unless the last one is more than five minutes old
  useExpiredCache: true, // If the cached configuration is expired, use it to serve assignments until an updated one is fetched
  requestTimeoutMs: 500, // Give up on fetching updated configurations after half a second and--if this is the first-ever initialization--just serve default values
  numInitialRequestRetries: 0, // Don't retry a failed initialization fetch
});
```

Note that when new configurations are loaded, the same flag may start getting a different assignment for the same session. If you want to avoid this, and have consistent assignments until the next initialization, change `updateOnFetch` to `empty`.
You could consider caches always expired so that it non-blocking loads an updated configuration to be used in the next session.

```ts
import { init } from "@eppo/js-client-sdk";

await init({
  apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
  maxCacheAgeSeconds: 0, // Always consider cached configurations expired
  // Settings set to non-default values
  updateOnFetch: 'empty', // Immediately start using the new configuration once it is fetched
  useExpiredCache: true, // Always used the previously cached assignments
  requestTimeoutMs: 500, // Give up on fetching updated configurations after half a second and--if this is the first-ever initialization--just serve default values
  numInitialRequestRetries: 0, // Don't retry a failed initialization fetch
});
```

### Offline initialization

Eppo's SDK supports offline initialization. This is useful if you want to initialize the SDK with a configuration from your server SDK or other external process. In this mode the SDK will not attempt to fetch a configuration from Eppo's CDN, instead only using the provided values.

This function is synchronous and ready to handle assignments after it returns.

```javascript
import { offlineInit, Flag, ObfuscatedFlag } from "@eppo/js-client-sdk";

// configuration from your server SDK
const configurationJsonString: string = getConfigurationFromServer();

// The configuration will be not-obfuscated from your server SDK.
// If you have obfuscated flag values, you can use the `ObfuscatedFlag` type.
const flagsConfiguration: Record<string, Flag | ObfuscatedFlag> = JSON.parse(configurationJsonString);

offlineInit({ 
  flagsConfiguration,
  // If you have obfuscated flag values, you can use the `ObfuscatedFlag` type.
  isObfuscated: true,
 });
```

The `offlineInit` function accepts the following optional configuration arguments.

### Offline Initialization Options

</ApiOptionRef>
<ApiOptionRef 
  name="flagsConfiguration"
  type="Record <string, Flag | ObfuscatedFlag>"
  defaultValue="null"
>

The flags configuration to use for the SDK.
</ApiOptionRef>

<ApiOptionRef 
  name="isObfuscated"
  type="boolean"
  defaultValue="false"

</ApiOptionRef>
<ApiOptionRef 
  name="throwOnFailedInitialization"
  type="boolean"

## Precomputed Assignments

Precomputed assignments -- where all flag assignments have already been computed, and the results are used to initialize the SDK -- may sometimes be preferable. For example, if you are optimizing for smaller configuration payloads or want to hide targeting rules completely. See [Precomputed Assignments](/sdks/client-sdks/javascript/precomputed-assignments) for more details.
