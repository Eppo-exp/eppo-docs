## Usage with Contextual Multi-Armed Bandits

Eppo supports contextual [multi-armed bandits](/contextual-bandits). You configure bandit flags in the Eppo application, where you can set up:

- Flag keys
- Status quo variations
- Bandit variations
- Targeting rules

When you query the bandit in your code, you provide the available actions to the SDK.

To leverage bandits using the Dart SDK, there are two additional steps over regular feature flags:

1. Implement a logger that handles bandit actions
2. Query the bandit for an action

### Define a bandit assignment logger

In order for the bandit to learn an optimized policy, we need to capture and log the bandit's actions.
The Dart SDK uses a single logger class that handles both assignment and bandit action logging:

```dart
// Implement your own `BanditLogger`
class YourBanditLogger implements BanditLogger {
  @override
  void logBanditEvent(BanditEvent event) {
    // Your logging logic here
  }
}
await Eppo.initialize(
  PrecomputeArguments(subject: subject),
  SdkOptions(
    sdkKey: 'your-sdk-key',
    banditLogger: YourBanditLogger(),
  )
);
```

The SDK will invoke the `logBanditAction()` method with a `BanditEvent` object containing the following fields:

```dart
/// Represents a bandit event.
class BanditEvent {
  /// The timestamp when the event occurred
  final String timestamp;

  /// The feature flag key
  final String featureFlag;

  /// The bandit key
  final String bandit;

  /// The subject key
  final String subject;

  /// The action associated with the bandit
  final String? action;

  /// The probability of the action
  final double? actionProbability;

  /// The optimality gap
  final double? optimalityGap;

  /// The model version
  final String? modelVersion;

  /// Numeric attributes of the subject
  final Map<String, double>? subjectNumericAttributes;

  /// Categorical attributes of the subject
  final Map<String, String>? subjectCategoricalAttributes;

  /// Numeric attributes of the action
  final Map<String, double>? actionNumericAttributes;

  /// Categorical attributes of the action
  final Map<String, String>? actionCategoricalAttributes;

  /// Metadata about the SDK
  final Map<String, dynamic> metaData;
}
```

Example of a `BanditEvent`:

| Field                          | Example                          |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| `timestamp`                    | `"2024-03-22T14:26:55.000Z"`     |
| `featureFlag`                  | `"bandit-test-allocation-4"`     |
| `bandit`                       | `"ad-bandit-1"`                  |
| `subject`                      | `"ed6f85019080"`                 |
| `subjectNumericAttributes`     | `{"age": 30}`                    |
| `subjectCategoricalAttributes` | `{"loyalty_tier": "gold"}`       |
| `action`                       | `"promo-20%-off"`                |
| `actionNumericAttributes`      | `{"brandAffinity": 0.2}`         |
| `actionCategoricalAttributes`  | `{"previouslyPurchased": false}` |
| `actionProbability`            | `0.25`                           |
| `optimalityGap`                | `456`                            |
| `modelVersion`                 | `"v123"`                         |
| `metaData`                     | `{ "sdkLibVersion": "3.5.1" }`   |

### Query the bandit for an action

To query the bandit for an action, use the `getBanditAction()` method. This method takes the following parameters:

- `flagKey (String)`: The key of the feature flag corresponding to the bandit
- `defaultValue (String)`: The default _variation_ to return if the flag is not successfully evaluated

```dart
final result = Eppo.getBanditAction(
  'flag-with-shoe-bandit',
  'default'
);

if (result.action != null) {
  // Follow the Bandit action
  renderShoeAd(result.action!);
} else {
  // User was not selected for a Bandit.
  // A variation is still assigned.
  renderDefaultShoeAd(result.variation);
}
```

### Bandit Result

The `getBanditAction()` method returns a `BanditEvaluation` object with the following properties:

- `variation (String)`: The variation assigned to the subject
- `action (String?)`: The action selected by the bandit, or null if no bandit action was selected

### Subject Attributes

The subject contains contextual information about the subject that is independent of bandit actions.
For example, the subject's age or country.

### Action Attributes

The action attributes contain contextual information about each action.

For simple cases where actions don't have attributes, you can also pass a list of action names as a map: `Map<String, Map<String, Map<String, dynamic>>>`.

```dart
final actions = {
  'nike': {
    'brand_affinity': 0.4,
    'from': 'usa',
  },
  
}
```

## Debugging

You may encounter a situation where a flag assignment produces a value that you did not expect. 
There are functions [detailed here](/sdks/sdk-features/debugging-flag-assignment/) to help you understand how flags are assigned, 
which will allow you to take corrective action on potential configuration issues.
