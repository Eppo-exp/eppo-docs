The Eppo SDK enables feature flags and experiments in your Dart and Flutter applications with only a few lines of code.

The SDK handles all the complexity of feature flag evaluation and experiment assignment locally in your application. 
This guide will walk you through installing the SDK and implementing your first feature flag, experiment, and contextual bandit.

## Installation

First, add the SDK to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  eppo: ^1.0.0
```

If using Dart, run:

```shell
dart pub get
```

If using Flutter, run:

```shell
flutter pub get
```

## Feature Flags

Feature flags are a way to toggle features on and off without needing to deploy code.

### Initialize the SDK

[Create an SDK key](/sdks/sdk-keys) if you don't already have one.

```dart
import 'package:eppo/eppo.dart';

// Create subject
final subject = Subject(
  subjectKey: subjectKey,
  subjectAttributes: ContextAttributes(),
);

// Create precompute arguments
final precomputeArgs = PrecomputeArguments(subject: subject);

// Create SDK options
final sdkOptions = SdkOptions(
  sdkKey: sdkKey
);

// Create client
Eppo.initialize(precomputeArgs, sdkOptions);
```

:::note
The SDK key is different from the project API key. You can find your SDK key in the [SDK Keys section of the Eppo interface](https://eppo.cloud/configuration/environments/keys).
:::

### How assignments work

On session start, the SDK retrieves precomputed evaluation of configuration rules from the Eppo Edge server that define how your subject should be allocated to variants.
The configuration is cached locally; when you call an assignment function, the SDK evaluates these rules locally without making additional network requests.

Initializing the SDK requires:

- **SDK Key**: Authorizes the SDK to connect to the Eppo environment
- **Subject Key**: A unique identifier for the subject (usually a user ID)

Each assignment requires:

- **Flag Key**: Identifies which set of configuration rules to use
- **Default Value**: Fallback value if assignment fails or rules don't match

```dart
// Make an assignment
final String variation = Eppo.getStringAssignment(
  'my-neat-feature',
  'default-value',
);
```

### Assignment Types

The SDK provides different assignment functions based on the type of value you need:

| Function                 | Return Type            |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| `getBooleanAssignment()` | `bool`                 |
| `getIntegerAssignment()` | `int`                  |
| `getNumericAssignment()` | `num`                  |
| `getStringAssignment()`  | `String`               |
| `getJSONAssignment()`    | `Map<String, dynamic>` |

### Using Assignments

After receiving an assignment, your application should implement logic to modify the user experience accordingly:

```dart
final String variation = Eppo.getStringAssignment(
  'my-neat-feature',
  'default-value',
);

// Render different components based on assignment
switch(variation) {
  case 'landing-page-a':
    return renderLandingPageA();
  case 'landing-page-b':
    return renderLandingPageB();
  default:
    return renderLandingPageC();
}
```

## Experiments

While feature flags are useful, they do not send you any information about how your users are interacting with the feature. 
Experiments provide a way to collect data about these interactions using whichever logging and data warehousing system you prefer.

To log events through the SDK, you need to provide a logger when initializing the client:

```dart
/// Represents an assignment event.
class AssignmentEvent {
  /// The allocation the subject was assigned to
  final String? allocation;

  /// The experiment identifier
  final String? experiment;

  /// The feature flag identifier
  final String featureFlag;

  /// The format of the assignment
  final String format;

  /// The variation key that was assigned
  final String? variation;

  /// The subject identifier
  final String subject;

  /// The timestamp of the assignment
  final String timestamp;

  /// The subject attributes
  final Map<String, dynamic>? subjectAttributes;

  /// Additional metadata
  final Map<String, dynamic>? metaData;
}

// Implement your own `AssignmentLogger`
class YourAssignmentLogger implements AssignmentLogger {
  @override
  void logAssignment(AssignmentEvent event) {
    // Your logging logic here
  }
}

await Eppo.initialize(
  PrecomputeArguments(subject: subject),
  SdkOptions(
    sdkKey: sdkKey,
    assignmentLogger: YourAssignmentLogger(),
  ),
);
```

:::note
For your production application, we have documentation on how to set up logging with multiple popular data warehouses and 
logging systems in the [Assignment page](/sdks/client-sdks/flutter-web/assignments/#logging-data-to-your-data-warehouse).
:::

## Contextual Bandits

For bandits, a separate logger handles its logging:

```dart
/// Represents a bandit event.
class BanditEvent {
  /// The timestamp when the event occurred
  final String timestamp;

  /// The feature flag key
  final String featureFlag;

  /// The bandit key
  final String bandit;

  /// The subject key
  final String subject;

  /// The action associated with the bandit
  final String? action;

  /// The probability of the action
  final double? actionProbability;

  /// The optimality gap
  final double? optimalityGap;

  /// The model version
  final String? modelVersion;

  /// Numeric attributes of the subject
  final Map<String, double>? subjectNumericAttributes;

  /// Categorical attributes of the subject
  final Map<String, String>? subjectCategoricalAttributes;

  /// Numeric attributes of the action
  final Map<String, double>? actionNumericAttributes;

  /// Categorical attributes of the action
  final Map<String, String>? actionCategoricalAttributes;

  /// Metadata about the SDK
  final Map<String, dynamic> metaData;
}

// Implement your own `BanditLogger`
class YourBanditLogger implements BanditLogger {
  @override
  void logBanditEvent(BanditEvent event) {
    // Your logging logic here
  }
}

await Eppo.initialize(
  PrecomputeArguments(
    subject: subject,
    banditActions: {
      'flag-with-shoe-bandit': {
        'nike': {
          'brand_affinity': 0.4,
          'from': 'usa',
        },
        'adidas': {
          'brand_affinity': 2.0,
          'from': 'germany',
        },
      },
    },
  ),
  SdkOptions(
    sdkKey: sdkKey,
    banditLogger: YourBanditLogger(),
  ),
);
```

### Query the bandit for actions

Instead of making simple assignments with a bandit, you will want to query the bandit for actions:

```dart
// Get bandit action
final result = Eppo.getBanditAction(
  'flag-with-shoe-bandit',
  'default'
);

if (result.action != null) {
  // Follow the Bandit action
  renderShoeAd(result.action!);
} else {
  // User was not selected for a Bandit.
  // A variation is still assigned.
  renderDefaultShoeAd(result.variation);
}
```

## Next Steps

Now that you've seen how to make assignments with the Eppo Dart SDK, we strongly recommend familiarizing yourself with the following topics:

- [High Level concepts for the client API](/sdks/server-sdks)
- [Initialization Configuration](/sdks/client-sdks/flutter-web/initialization)
- [Assignment details](/sdks/client-sdks/flutter-web/assignments)
