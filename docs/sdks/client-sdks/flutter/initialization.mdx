The Eppo SDK for Dart and Flutter is easy to initialize while offering robust customization options, 
making it adaptable to various use cases such as custom caching requirements and ultra-low-latency initialization.

## Initialize the SDK

To complete basic initialization, you only need to provide an SDK key. [Create an SDK key](/sdks/sdk-keys) if you don't already have one.

Add the Eppo Dart SDK to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  eppo: ^1.0.0
```

Then, initialize the SDK:

```dart
import 'package:eppo/eppo.dart';

final subject = Subject(
  subjectKey: 'user-identifier',
  subjectAttributes: ContextAttributes(),
);

await Eppo.initialize(
  PrecomputeArguments(subject: subject),
  SdkOptions(
    sdkKey: 'your-sdk-key'
  ),
);
```

## Use the SDK instance

After initialization, you can use the SDK singleton to assign a variation to a subject using the assignment methods.

```dart
final bool variation = Eppo.getBooleanAssignment(
  '<flag-key>',
  false,
);
```

### Example Configuration

Here's an example of initializing the SDK with custom configuration:

```dart
import 'package:eppo/eppo.dart';

class YourAssignmentLogger implements AssignmentLogger {
  @override
  void logAssignment(AssignmentEvent event) {
    print('warehouse assignment logged:', event.toJson());
  }
}

class YourBanditLogger implements BanditLogger {
  @override
  void logBanditEvent(BanditEvent event) {
    print('warehouse bandit logged:', event.toJson());
  }
}

await Eppo.initialize(
  PrecomputeArguments(subject: subject),
  SdkOptions(
    sdkKey: 'your-sdk-key',
    assignmentLogger: YourAssignmentLogger(),
    banditLogger: YourBanditLogger(),
  )
);
```

### Configuration Caching

The SDK caches configurations in memory to ensure fast assignment evaluations. The cache is automatically updated when new configurations are fetched from the Eppo Edge server.

## Best Practices

1. **Initialize Once**: The SDK is a singleton, initialize it once at application startup and reuse it throughout your application.
2. **Wait for Readiness**: Optionally, await `initialize` before making assignments to ensure configurations are loaded.
3. **Implement Proper Logging**: Configure an assignment logger to ensure experiment data is captured correctly.
4. **Use Subjects Consistently**: Ensure that subject IDs are consistent across your application to maintain experiment integrity.
