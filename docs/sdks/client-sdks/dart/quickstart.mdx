The Eppo SDK enables feature flags and experiments in your Dart and Flutter applications with only a few lines of code.

The SDK handles all the complexity of feature flag evaluation and experiment assignment locally in your application. 
This guide will walk you through installing the SDK and implementing your first feature flag, experiment, and contextual bandit.

## Installation

First, add the SDK to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  eppo: ^1.0.0
```

If using Dart, run:

```shell
dart pub get
```

If using Flutter, run:

```shell
flutter pub get
```

## Feature Flags

Feature flags are a way to toggle features on and off without needing to deploy code.

### Initialize the SDK

[Create an SDK key](/sdks/sdk-keys) if you don't already have one.

```dart
import 'package:eppo/eppo.dart';

// Initialize the SDK
await Eppo.initialize(
  'your-sdk-key',
  SubjectEvaluation(
    subject: Subject(
      subjectKey: 'user-identifier'
    )
  )
);
```
:::note
The SDK key is different from the project API key. You can find your SDK key in the [SDK Keys section of the Eppo interface](https://eppo.cloud/configuration/environments/keys).
:::

### How assignments work

On session start, the SDK retrieves precomputed evaluation of configuration rules from the Eppo Edge server that define how your subject should be allocated to variants.
The configuration is cached locally; when you call an assignment function, the SDK evaluates these rules locally without making additional network requests.

Initializing the SDK requires:

- **SDK Key**: Authorizes the SDK to connect to the Eppo environment
- **Subject Evaluation**: Contains the subject key and optional attributes
- **Client Configuration**: Contains SDK platform and optional loggers

Each assignment requires:

- **Flag Key**: Identifies which set of configuration rules to use
- **Default Value**: Fallback value if assignment fails or rules don't match

```dart
// Make an assignment
final String variation = Eppo.getStringAssignment(
  'my-neat-feature',
  'default-value',
);
```

### Assignment Types

The SDK provides different assignment functions based on the type of value you need:

| Function                 | Return Type            |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| `getBooleanAssignment()` | `bool`                 |
| `getIntegerAssignment()` | `int`                  |
| `getNumericAssignment()` | `num`                  |
| `getStringAssignment()`  | `String`               |
| `getJSONAssignment()`    | `Map<String, dynamic>` |

### Using Assignments

After receiving an assignment, your application should implement logic to modify the user experience accordingly:

```dart
final String variation = Eppo.getStringAssignment(
  'my-neat-feature',
  'default-value',
);

// Render different components based on assignment
switch(variation) {
  case 'landing-page-a':
    return renderLandingPageA();
  case 'landing-page-b':
    return renderLandingPageB();
  default:
    return renderLandingPageC();
}
```

## Experiments

While feature flags are useful, they do not let you evaluate the impact of your feature on the users interacting with it. 
Experiments provide a way to collect data about these interactions using whichever logging and data warehousing system you prefer.

To log events through the SDK, you need to provide a logger when initializing the client:

```dart
/// Represents an assignment event.
class AssignmentEvent {
  /// The allocation the subject was assigned to
  final String? allocation;

  /// The experiment identifier
  final String? experiment;

  /// The feature flag identifier
  final String featureFlag;

  /// The format of the assignment
  final String format;

  /// The variation key that was assigned
  final String? variation;

  /// The subject identifier
  final String subject;

  /// The timestamp of the assignment
  final String timestamp;

  /// The subject attributes
  final Map<String, dynamic>? subjectAttributes;

  /// Additional metadata
  final Map<String, dynamic>? metaData;
}

// Implement your own `AssignmentLogger`
class MyAssignmentLogger implements AssignmentLogger {
  @override
  void logAssignment(AssignmentEvent event) {
    // Your logging logic here
    print('Assignment logged: ${event.toJson()}');
  }
}

// Initialize the SDK with a custom assignment logger
await Eppo.initialize(
  'your-sdk-key',
  SubjectEvaluation(subject: subject),
  ClientConfiguration(
    assignmentLogger: MyAssignmentLogger(),
  ),
);
```

:::note
For your production application, we have documentation on how to set up logging with multiple popular data warehouses and 
logging systems in the [Assignment page](/sdks/client-sdks/dart/assignments/#logging-data-to-your-data-warehouse).
:::

## Contextual Bandits

For bandits, a separate logger handles its logging, you supply the available actions and subject attributes, and the SDK provides 
an API to query the bandit for an action:

```dart
/// Represents a bandit event.
class BanditEvent {
  /// The timestamp when the event occurred
  final String timestamp;

  /// The feature flag key
  final String featureFlag;

  /// The bandit key
  final String bandit;

  /// The subject key
  final String subject;

  /// The action associated with the bandit
  final String? action;

  /// The probability of the action
  final double? actionProbability;

  /// The optimality gap
  final double? optimalityGap;

  /// The model version
  final String? modelVersion;

  /// Numeric attributes of the subject
  final Map<String, double>? subjectNumericAttributes;

  /// Categorical attributes of the subject
  final Map<String, String>? subjectCategoricalAttributes;

  /// Numeric attributes of the action
  final Map<String, double>? actionNumericAttributes;

  /// Categorical attributes of the action
  final Map<String, String>? actionCategoricalAttributes;

  /// Metadata about the SDK
  final Map<String, dynamic> metaData;
}

// Implement your own `BanditLogger`
class MyBanditLogger implements BanditLogger {
  @override
  void logBanditEvent(BanditEvent event) {
    // Your logging logic here
    print('Bandit event logged: ${event.toJson()}');
  }
}

// Create subject with attributes
final subject = Subject(
  subjectKey: 'user-identifier',
  subjectAttributes: ContextAttributes(
    categoricalAttributes: {'country': 'US'},
  ),
);

// Create subject evaluation with bandit actions
final subjectEvaluation = SubjectEvaluation(
  subject: subject,
  banditActions: {
    'flag-with-shoe-bandit': {
      'nike': {
        'brand_affinity': 0.4,
        'from': 'usa',
      },
      'adidas': {
        'brand_affinity': 2.0,
        'from': 'germany',
      },
    },
  },
);

// Initialize the SDK with a custom bandit logger
await Eppo.initialize(
  'your-sdk-key',
  subjectEvaluation,
  ClientConfiguration(
    banditLogger: MyBanditLogger(),
  ),
);
```

### Query the bandit for actions

Instead of making simple assignments with a bandit, you will want to query the bandit for actions:

```dart
// Get bandit action
final result = Eppo.getBanditAction(
  'flag-with-shoe-bandit',
  'default'
);

if (result.action != null) {
  // Follow the Bandit action
  renderShoeAd(result.action!);
} else {
  // User was not selected for a Bandit.
  // A variation is still assigned.
  renderDefaultShoeAd(result.variation);
}
```

:::note
For full steps to create a bandit including UI steps, see the [bandit quickstart](/bandit-quickstart).

## Flutter Integration

Ensure the Eppo SDK is initialized when the app is launched or resumed from the background.

Use the Flutter `AppLifecycleListener` to initialize the SDK when the app is launched:

```dart
// An example of an EppoObserver that initializes the SDK when the app is launched
class EppoObserver extends WidgetsBindingObserver {
  @override
  void didChangeAppLifecycleState(AppLifecycleState state) async {
    switch (state) {
      case AppLifecycleState.resumed:
        // Create subject and configuration
        final subject = Subject(subjectKey: 'user-identifier');
        final subjectEvaluation = SubjectEvaluation(subject: subject);
        final clientConfiguration = ClientConfiguration(sdkPlatform: SdkPlatform.flutter);
        
        // Initialize the SDK
        await Eppo.initialize('your-sdk-key', subjectEvaluation, clientConfiguration);
        break;
    }
  }
}

// Add the EppoObserver to the WidgetsBinding
@override
void initState() {
  super.initState();
  WidgetsBinding.instance.addObserver(EppoObserver());
}
```
