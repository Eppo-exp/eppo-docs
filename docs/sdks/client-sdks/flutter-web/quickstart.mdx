The Eppo SDK for Flutter Web enables feature flags and experiments in your Flutter Web applications with only a few lines of code.

The SDK handles all the complexity of feature flag evaluation and experiment assignment locally in your application. 
This guide will walk you through installing the SDK and implementing your first feature flag, experiment, and contextual bandit.

## Installation

First, add the Eppo JavaScript SDK to your script tag:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@eppo/js-client-sdk@latest/dist/eppo-sdk.min.js"></script>
```

Then, add the SDK to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  eppo_web_sdk: ^1.0.0
```

Finally, run:

```shell
flutter pub get
```

## Feature Flags

Feature flags are a way to toggle features on and off without needing to deploy code.

### Initialize the SDK

[Create an SDK key](/sdks/sdk-keys) if you don't already have one.

```dart
import 'dart:js_interop';
import 'dart:convert';
import 'package:eppo_web_sdk/eppo_web_sdk.dart';

// Wait for the client to be ready before making assignments
await eppo
  .init(
    EppoConfig(
      apiKey: '<SDK_KEY>'
    ),
  )
  .toDart;

// Get a handle to the client
final EppoClient client = eppo.getInstance();
```

:::note
The SDK key is different from the project API key. You can find your SDK key in the [SDK Keys section of the Eppo interface](https://eppo.cloud/configuration/environments/keys).
:::

### How assignments work

The SDK retrieves configuration rules from the Eppo server that define how subjects should be allocated to variants. 
When you call an assignment function, the SDK evaluates these rules locally without making additional network requests.

Each assignment requires:

- **Flag Key**: Identifies which set of configuration rules to use
- **Subject Key**: A unique identifier for the subject (usually a user ID)
- **Subject Attributes**: Optional key-value pairs containing additional information used for rule evaluation
- **Default Value**: Fallback value if assignment fails or rules don't match

```dart
// Make an assignment
final String variation = client.getStringAssignment(
  'my-neat-feature',
  '<subject-key>',
  {'country': 'US', 'device': 'mobile'}.jsify() as JSAny,
  'default-value',
);
```

### Assignment Types

The SDK provides different assignment functions based on the type of value you need:

| Function                 | Return Type            |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| `getStringAssignment()`  | `String`               |
| `getIntegerAssignment()` | `int`                  |
| `getNumericAssignment()` | `num`                  |
| `getBooleanAssignment()` | `bool`                 |
| `getJsonAssignment()`    | `JSAny`                |

### Using Assignments

After receiving an assignment, your application should implement logic to modify the user experience accordingly:

```dart
final String variation = client.getStringAssignment(
  'my-neat-feature',
  '<subject-key>',
  {'country': 'US', 'device': 'mobile'}.jsify() as JSAny,
  'default-value',
);

// Render different components based on assignment
switch(variation) {
  case 'landing-page-a':
    return renderLandingPageA();
  case 'landing-page-b':
    return renderLandingPageB();
  default:
    return renderLandingPageC();
}
```

## Experiments

While feature flags are useful, they do not send you any information about how your users are interacting with the feature. 
Experiments provide a way to collect data about these interactions using whichever logging and data warehousing system you prefer.

To log events through the SDK, you need to provide a logger when initializing the client:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="console" label="Console">

```dart
/// Represents an assignment event.
@JS()
@staticInterop
@anonymous
class AssignmentEvent {
  external factory AssignmentEvent();
}

/// Extension methods for AssignmentEvent.
extension AssignmentEventExtension on AssignmentEvent {
  external String? get allocation;
  external String? get experiment;
  external String get featureFlag;
  external String? get variation;
  external String get subject;
  external String get timestamp;
  external JSAny get subjectAttributes;
  external String get format;
  external FlagEvaluationDetails? get evaluationDetails;
}

await eppo
  .init(
    EppoConfig(
      apiKey: '<SDK_KEY>',
      assignmentLogger: AssignmentLogger(
        logAssignment:
          ((JSAny event) {
            final typedEvent = event as AssignmentEvent;
            print('warehouse assignment logged:', typedEvent.toJson());
          }
        ).toJS,
      )
    ),
  )
  .toDart;
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

:::note
In a production application, you would want to replace the `print` statement with an actual logging system. 
We have documentation on how to set up logging with multiple popular data warehouses and 
logging systems in the [Assignment page](/sdks/client-sdks/flutter-web/assignments/#logging-data-to-your-data-warehouse).
:::

## Contextual Bandits

For bandits, the same logger handles both assignment and bandit action logging:

```dart
/// Represents a bandit event.
@JS()
@staticInterop
@anonymous
class BanditEvent {
  external factory BanditEvent();
}

/// Extension methods for BanditEvent.
extension BanditEventExtension on BanditEvent {
  external String get banditKey;
  external String get action;
  external String get subject;
  external String get timestamp;
  external JSAny get subjectAttributes;
  external FlagEvaluationDetails? get evaluationDetails;
}

await eppo
  .init(
    EppoConfig(
      apiKey: '<SDK_KEY>',
      banditLogger: BanditLogger(
        logBanditEvent:
          ((JSAny event) {
            final typedEvent = event as BanditEvent;
            print('warehouse bandit event logged:', typedEvent.toJson());
          }
        ).toJS,
      ),
    ),
  )
  .toDart;
```

### Query the bandit for actions

Instead of making simple assignments with a bandit, you will want to query the bandit for actions:

```dart
// Get bandit action
final result = client.getBanditAction(
  'flag-with-shoe-bandit',
  '<subject-key>',
  {'age': 30, 'country': 'uk', 'pricingTier': '1'}.jsify() as JSAny,
  {
    'nike': [
      {'brand_affinity': 0.4},
      {'from': 'usa'},
    ],
    'adidas': [
      {'brand_affinity': 2.0},
      {'from': 'germany'}
    ]
  }.jsify() as JSAny,
  'default'
);

if (result.action != null) {
  // Follow the Bandit action
  renderShoeAd(result.action!);
} else {
  // User was not selected for a Bandit.
  // A variation is still assigned.
  renderDefaultShoeAd(result.variation);
}
```

:::note

## Next Steps

Now that you've seen how to make assignments with the Eppo Dart SDK, we strongly recommend familiarizing yourself with the following topics:

- [High Level concepts for the client API](/sdks/server-sdks)
- [Initialization Configuration](/sdks/client-sdks/flutter-web/initialization)
- [Assignment details](/sdks/client-sdks/flutter-web/assignments)
