The Eppo SDK for Flutter Web is easy to initialize while offering robust customization options, 
making it adaptable to various use cases such as custom caching requirements and ultra-low-latency initialization.

The SDK is built on top of the Eppo JavaScript SDK, using `dart:js_interop` to call the JavaScript SDK. 
The Dart package is a wrapper around the JavaScript SDK, providing typed bindings.

## Initialize the SDK

To complete basic initialization, you only need to provide an SDK key. [Create an SDK key](/sdks/sdk-keys) if you don't already have one.

Add the Eppo JavaScript SDK to your script tag:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@eppo/js-client-sdk@latest/dist/eppo-sdk.min.js"></script>
```

Add the Eppo Dart SDK to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  eppo_web_sdk: ^1.0.0
```

Then, initialize the SDK:

```dart
import 'dart:js_interop';
import 'package:eppo_web_sdk/eppo_web_sdk.dart';

await eppo
  .init(
    EppoConfig(apiKey: '<SDK_KEY>').jsify() as JSAny,
  )
  .toDart;
```

## Use the SDK instance

After initialization, you can use the SDK instance to assign a variation to a subject using the assignment methods.

```dart
final EppoClient client = eppo.getInstance();

final bool variation = client.getBooleanAssignment(
  '<flag-key>',
  '<subject-key>',
  {}.jsify() as JSAny,
  false,
);
```

## Advanced Configuration

Basic initialization is great for most use cases, but the SDK provides options that you can use during initialization to customize the behavior of the SDK.

### Initialization Options

How the SDK fetches, serves, and caches experiment configurations is configurable via the `EppoClient` constructor:

<ApiOptionRef 
  name="logger"
  type="AssignmentLogger"
  defaultValue="null"
>

A callback that sends each assignment to your data warehouse. Required for experiment analysis.

</ApiOptionRef>

<ApiOptionRef 
  name="BaseUrl"
  type="string"
  defaultValue="https://fscdn.eppo.cloud/api"
>

The base URL for the Eppo API. You typically won't need to change this unless you're using a custom endpoint.

</ApiOptionRef>

### Example Configuration

Here's an example of initializing the SDK with custom configuration:

```dart
import 'dart:js_interop';
import 'dart:convert';
import 'package:eppo_web_sdk/eppo_web_sdk.dart';

// Initialize with custom configuration and wait for the client to be ready
await eppo
  .init(
    EppoConfig(
      apiKey: '<SDK_KEY>',
      assignmentLogger: AssignmentLogger(
        logAssignment:
          ((JSAny event) {
            final typedEvent = event as AssignmentEvent;
            print('warehouse assignment logged:');
            print('  Feature flag: ${typedEvent.featureFlag}');
            print('  Subject: ${typedEvent.subject}');
            print('  Variation: ${typedEvent.variation}');
            print('  Timestamp: ${typedEvent.timestamp}');
            print(
              '  Subject attributes: ${typedEvent.subjectAttributes}',
            );
            print('  Allocation: ${typedEvent.allocation}');
            print('  Experiment: ${typedEvent.experiment}');
            print('  Format: ${typedEvent.format}');
            print(
              '  Evaluation details: ${typedEvent.evaluationDetails}',
            );
          }
        ).toJS,
      )
    ),
  )
  .toDart;
```

### Configuration Caching

The SDK caches configurations in memory to ensure fast assignment evaluations. The cache is automatically updated based on the polling interval.

## Best Practices

1. **Initialize Once**: Create a single instance of the SDK at application startup and reuse it throughout your application.
2. **Wait for Readiness**: Optionally, await `init` before making assignments to ensure configurations are loaded.
3. **Implement Proper Logging**: Configure a proper assignment logger to ensure experiment data is captured correctly.
4. **Use Subjects Consistently**: Ensure that subject IDs are consistent across your application to maintain experiment integrity.
