The Eppo SDK for Flutter Web is easy to initialize while offering robust customization options, making it adaptable to various use cases such as custom caching requirements and ultra-low-latency initialization.

The SDK is built on top of the Eppo JavaScript SDK, using `dart:js_interop` to call the JavaScript SDK. The Dart package is a wrapper around the JavaScript SDK, provided typed bindings.

## Initialize the SDK

To complete basic initialization, you only need to provide an SDK key. [Create an SDK key](/sdks/sdk-keys) if you don't already have one.

Add the Eppo JavaScript SDK to your script tag:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@eppo/js-client-sdk@latest/dist/eppo-sdk.min.js"></script>
```

Add the Eppo Dart SDK to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  eppo_web_sdk: ^1.0.0
```

Then, initialize the SDK:

```dart
import 'dart:js_interop';
import 'package:eppo_web_sdk/eppo_web_sdk.dart';

await eppo
  .init(
    EppoConfig(apiKey: '<SDK_KEY>').jsify() as JSAny,
  )
  .toDart;
```

## Use the SDK instance

After initialization, you can use the SDK instance to assign a variation to a subject using the assignment methods.

```dart
final EppoClient client = eppo.getInstance();

final bool? variation = client.getBooleanAssignment(
  '<flag-key>',
  '<subject-key>',
  {}.jsify() as JSAny,
  false,
);
```

## Advanced Configuration

Basic initialization is great for most use cases, but the SDK provides options that you can use during initialization to customize the behavior of the SDK.

### Initialization Options

How the SDK fetches, serves, and caches experiment configurations is configurable via the `EppoClient` constructor:

<ApiOptionRef 
  name="logger"
  type="AssignmentLogger"
  defaultValue="null"
>

A callback that sends each assignment to your data warehouse. Required for experiment analysis.

</ApiOptionRef>

<ApiOptionRef 
  name="BaseUrl"
  type="string"
  defaultValue="https://fscdn.eppo.cloud/api"
>

The base URL for the Eppo API. You typically won't need to change this unless you're using a custom endpoint.

</ApiOptionRef>

### Example Configuration

Here's an example of initializing the SDK with custom configuration:

```dart
// Create a custom logger
final logger = MyAssignmentLogger();

// Initialize with custom configuration
final client = EppoClient(
  sdkKey: '<SDK_KEY>',
  baseUrl: Uri.parse('http://custom-endpoint.com/api'),
  logger: logger
);

// Wait for the client to be ready
await client.whenReady();
```

### Configuration Caching

The SDK caches configurations in memory to ensure fast assignment evaluations. The cache is automatically updated based on the polling interval.

```dart
class MyAssignmentLogger extends AssignmentLogger {
  const MyAssignmentLogger();

  @override
  void logAssignment(Map<String, dynamic> event) {
    // Send assignment data to your analytics system
    analytics.track('Eppo Assignment', event);
  }

  @override
  void logBanditAction(Map<String, dynamic> event) {
    // Send bandit action data to your analytics system
    analytics.track('Eppo Bandit Action', event);
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Initialize Once**: Create a single instance of the SDK at application startup and reuse it throughout your application.
2. **Wait for Readiness**: Optionally, await `init` before making assignments to ensure configurations are loaded.
3. **Implement Proper Logging**: Configure a proper assignment logger to ensure experiment data is captured correctly.
4. **Use Subjects Consistently**: Ensure that subject IDs are consistent across your application to maintain experiment integrity.
