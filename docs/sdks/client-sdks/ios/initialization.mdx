The Eppo iOS SDK is easy to initialize while offering robust customization options, making it adaptable to various use cases such as offline mode, custom caching requirements, and ultra-low-latency initialization.

## Initialize the SDK

To complete basic initialization, you only need to provide an SDK key which you can create in the Eppo UI under **Configuration** > **Environments** > **API Keys**.

```swift
import EppoFlagging

Task {
    try await EppoClient.initialize(sdkKey: "SDK-KEY-FROM-DASHBOARD");
}
```

:::tip
Wrap initialization in a `Task` block in order to perform network request asynchronously.
:::

## Use the SDK instance

After initialization, you can use the SDK instance by calling `shared()`. You can then use the SDK instance to assign a variation to a subject using the `get*Assignment` functions.

```swift
let eppoClient = EppoClient.shared()
let user = getCurrentUser()
```

## Advanced Configuration

Basic initialization is great for most use cases, but the SDK provides options that you can use during initialization to customize the behavior of the SDK.

### Initialization with Assignment Logger

When using the SDK for experiments (rather than just feature flags), you'll need to add a logging callback during initialization:

```swift
eppoClient = try await EppoClient.initialize(
    sdkKey: "mock-sdk-key",
    assignmentLogger: segmentAssignmentLogger
)

// Example of a simple assignmentLogger function
func segmentAssignmentLogger(assignment: Assignment) {
    let assignmentDictionary: [String: Any] = [
        "allocation": assignment.allocation,
        "experiment": assignment.experiment,
        "featureFlag": assignment.featureFlag,
        "variation": assignment.variation,
        "subject": assignment.subject,
        "timestamp": assignment.timestamp
    ]

    analytics.track(
        name: "Eppo Assignment",
        properties: TrackProperties(assignmentDictionary)
    )
}
```

### Initialization Modes

The SDK supports different initialization modes to suit your needs:

#### Standard Initialization
The default initialization mode fetches configurations from Eppo's CDN:

```swift
import EppoFlagging

Task {
    try await EppoClient.initialize(sdkKey: "SDK-KEY-FROM-DASHBOARD");
}
```

#### Initialization with Automatic Configuration Updates (Polling)

The SDK can be configured to automatically poll for configuration updates at regular intervals. This is useful for ensuring your application always has the latest flag configurations.

To enable polling during initialization:

```swift
Task {
    try await EppoClient.initialize(
        sdkKey: "SDK-KEY-FROM-DASHBOARD",
        pollingEnabled: true,
        pollingIntervalMs: 300_000,  // 5 minutes (default)
        pollingJitterMs: 30_000      // 10% of polling interval (default)
    )
}
```

You can also start and stop polling after initialization:

```swift
let eppoClient = EppoClient.shared()

// Start polling with custom intervals
try await eppoClient.startPolling(
    intervalMs: 300_000,  // 5 minutes
    jitterMs: 30_000      // Jitter of up to 30 seconds
)

// Stop polling
eppoClient.stopPolling()
```

The polling mechanism includes the following features:
- Default polling interval of 5 minutes (300,000 ms)
- Random jitter to prevent thundering herd problems (default is 10% of polling interval)
- Automatic retry up to 7 times on failed requests
- Exponential backoff on failures
- Polling stops automatically if max retries are exceeded

:::note
For battery efficiency in mobile applications, it's recommended to stop polling when your app goes to the background and resume when it comes to the foreground.
:::

#### Initialization with Pre-fetched Configuration
You can pass in a pre-fetched flag configuration JSON string:

```swift
Task {
    try await EppoClient.initialize(
        sdkKey: "SDK-KEY-FROM-DASHBOARD",
        initialConfiguration: try Configuration(
            flagsConfigurationJson: Data(#"{ "pre-loaded-JSON": "passed in here" }"#.utf8),
            obfuscated: false
        )
    );
}
```

This will still perform a network request to fetch the latest flag configurations. The provided configuration will be used until the network request is successful.

#### Offline Initialization
If you'd like to initialize Eppo's client without performing a network request, you can use the `initializeOffline` method:

```swift
try EppoClient.initializeOffline(
    sdkKey: "SDK-KEY-FROM-DASHBOARD",
    initialConfiguration: try Configuration(
        flagsConfigurationJson: Data(#"{ "pre-loaded-JSON": "passed in here" }"#.utf8),
        obfuscated: false
    )
);
```

The `obfuscated` parameter is used to inform the SDK if the flag configuration is obfuscated.

#### Offline Initialization with Configuration Management

While the basic offline initialization approach is designed for pre-loading the configuration from a server environment, some application architectures may require different approaches to configuration management. Here are two alternative approaches that provide more flexibility:

##### 1. Using Configuration Objects Directly

You can extract the configuration object in your application and use it to initialize a new client. This approach works well when your application can maintain the configuration in memory or when transferring configurations within the same Swift application:

```swift
// Get configuration from an existing client
let configuration = existingClient.getFlagsConfiguration()
EppoClient.resetSharedInstance()

// Later, initialize a new client with the configuration object
let newClient = EppoClient.initializeOffline(
    sdkKey: "SDK-KEY-FROM-DASHBOARD",
    initialConfiguration: configuration
)
```

##### 2. Using JSON String Serialization

The JSON string serialization approach, an alternative to the configuration object approach, is useful when:
- You need to persist configurations between app launches in platform-agnostic storage
- You need to transfer configurations through non-Swift environments or systems

```swift
// Get configuration from an existing client and convert to string
let configuration = existingClient.getFlagsConfiguration()
let configurationString = try configuration.toJsonString()

// Later, initialize a new client using the JSON string
let newClient = EppoClient.initializeOffline(
    sdkKey: "SDK-KEY-FROM-DASHBOARD",
    initialConfiguration: try Configuration(
        flagsConfigurationJson: Data(configurationString.utf8),
        obfuscated: false
    )
)
```

These approaches provide more flexibility than basic offline initialization for when your application needs to bootstrap before network connectivity is available and maintain that state between app launches.

In both approaches, the configuration object contains all necessary information including flags, variations, and allocation rules, allowing the SDK to make assignment decisions without requiring network connectivity.

### Configuration Updates

#### Fetching Updated Configurations
After the client has been initialized, you can use `load()` to asynchronously fetch the latest flag configuration from the remote source:

```swift
try EppoClient.initializeOffline(
    sdkKey: "SDK-KEY-FROM-DASHBOARD",
    initialConfiguration: try Configuration(
        flagsConfigurationJson: Data(#"{ "pre-loaded-JSON": "passed in here" }"#.utf8),
        obfuscated: false
    )
);

// Later, fetch updated configurations
Task {
    try await EppoClient.shared().load();
}
```

:::note
As modern iOS devices have substantial memory, applications are often kept in memory across sessions. This means that the flag configurations are not automatically reloaded on subsequent launches.

It is recommended to use the `load()` method to fetch the latest flag configurations when the application is launched.

### Assignment Logger Schema

The SDK will invoke the `logAssignment` function with an `Assignment` object that contains the following fields:

<ApiOptionRef
  name="timestamp"
  type="string"
  defaultValue=""
>

The time when the subject was assigned to the variation. Example: `"2021-06-22T17:35:12.000Z"`
</ApiOptionRef>

<ApiOptionRef
  name="featureFlag"
  type="string"
  defaultValue=""
>

An Eppo feature flag key. Example: `"recommendation-algo"`
</ApiOptionRef>

<ApiOptionRef
  name="allocation"
  type="string"
  defaultValue=""
>

An Eppo allocation key. Example: `"allocation-17"`
</ApiOptionRef>

<ApiOptionRef
  name="experiment"
  type="string"
  defaultValue=""
>

An Eppo experiment key. Example: `"recommendation-algo-allocation-17"`
</ApiOptionRef>

<ApiOptionRef
  name="subject"
  type="string"
  defaultValue=""
>

An identifier of the subject or user assigned to the experiment variation. Example: UUID
</ApiOptionRef>

<ApiOptionRef
  name="subjectAttributes"
  type="[String: EppoValue]"
  defaultValue="[:]"
>

A dictionary mapping String keys to EppoValue values. These attributes are used for targeting and are only logged if passed to the SDK assignment function. EppoValue can be a String, Number, or Boolean.
</ApiOptionRef>

<ApiOptionRef
  name="variation"
  type="string"
  defaultValue="undefined"
>

The experiment variation the subject was assigned to. Example: `"control"`
</ApiOptionRef>
