The Eppo iOS SDK enables feature flags and experiments in your iOS applications with just a few lines of code. It handles flag evaluation and experiment assignments locally on the device, making it fast and reliable for your users.

## Installation

While in XCode:

1. Choose `Package Dependencies`
2. Click `+` and enter package URL: `git@github.com:Eppo-exp/eppo-ios-sdk.git`
3. Set dependency rule to `Up to Next Minor Version` and select `Add Package`
4. Add to your project's target.

## Feature Flags

### Initialize the SDK

First, initialize the SDK with your API key. You'll need to do this early in your application lifecycle:

```swift
Task {
    try await EppoClient.initialize(sdkKey: "SDK-KEY-FROM-DASHBOARD");
}
```

:::tip
Get your SDK key from the [Eppo web interface](https://eppo.cloud/feature-flags/keys).
:::

### Make Assignments

Once initialized, you can start using feature flags anywhere in your app:

```swift
let eppoClient = EppoClient.shared()

// Check if a feature should be enabled
let userId = getCurrentUserId() // Your user identification logic
var attributes = ["userType": "premium", "country": "US"]

let isEnabled = try eppoClient.getBooleanAssignment(
    flagKey: "new-feature",
    subjectKey: userId,
    subjectAttributes: attributes,
    defaultValue: false
)

if isEnabled {
    // Show new feature
    showNewFeature()
} else {
    // Show existing feature
    showExistingFeature()
}
```
