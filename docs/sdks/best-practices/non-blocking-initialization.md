# Non-blocking initialization

Most initialization methods in Eppoâ€™s SDKs are non-blocking in order to minimize their footprint on the applications in which they are run. One consequence of this, however, is that it is possible to invoke the `get<Type>Assignment` method before the SDK has finished initializing. If `get<Type>Assignment` is invoked before the SDK has finished initializing, the SDK may not have access to the most recent configurations. There are two possible outcomes when `get<Type>Assignment` is invoked before the SDK has finished initializing:

1. If the SDK downloads configurations to a persistent store, e.g. the JavaScript client SDK uses local storage, and a configuration was previously downloaded, then the SDK will assign a variation based on a previously downloaded configuration.

2. If no configurations were previously downloaded or the SDK stores the configuration in memory and loses it during re-initialization, then the SDK will return the default value when `get<Type>Assignment` is invoked.

Most SDKs have an option to `waitForInitialization`, as well as flexible initialization options that you can pass in at initialization.
