# Test Designs

Eppo Geolift's features can be combined into a number of frequent test designs. When creating the Geolift test, the user specifies the Business Objective and our team helps fit a test design to your data and objectives.

Here are many of the most frequently used test designs:

| Business objective | Test objective | Number of variants | Daily Spend Data Enabled? |
|-------------------|----------------|-------------------|------------------------|
| Evaluate new advertising initiative | Test markets: Initiative is not launched yet as Business-as-Usual; launch in minimal regions to minimize test cost | 2-cell | Yes |
| Evaluate existing advertising initiative | Go dark: Initiative is launched within eligible treatment regions; disable in sufficient regions to evaluate efficacy while minimizing opportunity cost | 2-cell | Yes |
| Evaluate existing advertising initiative | Baseline incrementality and budget saturation: Evaluate baseline efficacy and budget saturation while minimizing opportunity cost | 3-cell | Yes |
| Evaluate non-advertising initiative | Open design: no assumptions | 2-cell or 3-cell | No |
