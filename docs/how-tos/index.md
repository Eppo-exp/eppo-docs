## Data management

- Learn how to [debug issues](/how-tos/debugging-metrics) with experiment metrics.
- Setting up your data warehouse for efficient computation can make a big difference in compute, so we have a guide on [best practices](/how-tos/warehouse-best-practices).

### Conecting your data warehouse

There are in depth guides to connect Eppo to each of the supported data warehouse platforms:

- [Bigquery](/how-tos/connecting-dwh/bigquery)
- [Databricks](/how-tos/connecting-dwh/databricks)
- [Redshift](/how-tos/connecting-dwh/redshift)
- [Snowflake](/how-tos/connecting-dwh/snowflake)

## Experimentation

- Learn how to set up [event logging](/how-tos/event-logging/) with Segment, Rudderstack, mParticle, or Snowplow.
- Analyze experiments with [anonymous user IDs](/how-tos/anonymous-explainer).
