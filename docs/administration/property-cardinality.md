# Metric Property Cardinality Limit

You can minimize warehouse costs by limiting the number of computed values for all metric properties. Applying a limit here will cap the number of values computed for Explores and Property Analysis on experiments.

The cardinality limit will limit computation to the top most frequently occurring values per property.

You can configure the cardinality limit by clicking on the Metric Property Cardinality Limit tile in Admin.
