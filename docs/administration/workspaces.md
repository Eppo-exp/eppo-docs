# Workspaces

Each Workspace in Eppo is connected to one data warehouse and has it's own Facts, Metrics, Experiments, and Flags. By default each customer has one Workspace.

Additional Workspaces are available for Enterprise customers who fit the following criteria:
* Have multiple products or apps with a different set of Facts and Metrics
* Are transitioning from their current data warehouse to another
* Need a API QA environment

Workspaces can be accessed through the the Workspace picker by clicking on the company name in the side nav.

Please contact <a href="mailto:support@eppo.com">Eppo support</a> to add additional Workspaces.
