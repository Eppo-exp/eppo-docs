# Teams

Create teams in your workspace to organize users and the scope of ownership of experiments, metrics, and feature flags in Eppo.

## Configure
Only Admins have permission to create, edit, and archive teams.

### Create Teams
Create teams under the [Teams home](https://eppo.cloud/teams) by selecting an icon and giving the team a name. 

### Archive Teams
Archive teams by selecting from the more menu. Archiving cannot be undone and will prevent this team from being assigned to future users, experiments, metrics, and feature flags.

To keep a historical record, all currently assigned objects will remain assigned to the archived team and can be re-assigned as needed.


## Assigning Users to Teams
Assign users to teams under the [Admin > Users tab](https://eppo.cloud/admin/users_and_permissions?show=1-25). Users can be members of multiple teams.
