## What is the Statistical Analysis Plan?
The Statistical Analysis Plan determines the statistical methods used to analyze your experiments.
* Confidence Interval Method: Sequential, Fixed Sample, Bayesian
* Confidence Level: The percent of time the confidence interval contains the true lift
* Desired Power (for the progress bar): The percent of the time the minimum effect size will be detected, assuming it exists.


## How to Change the Defaults
You can define the defaults for the statistical methods used for experiments across Eppo by going to **Admin > Settings > Statistical Analyis Plan**. 

The settings defined at the Admin level will be the company-wide defaults for any “draft”, “running”,  and “wrap up” experiments that have not opted out of using the defaults. Individual experiments can choose to opt out of the company-wide defaults and use different settings. See how to set the statistical analysis plan at the experiment level.
