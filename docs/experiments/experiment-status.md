# Experiment status

You can navigate to the **Experiments** page by clicking on the **Experiments** icon from the left tab. Each experiment has an associated status which indicates the current state of the experiment. An experiment can have one of 4 different statuses:

1. Draft - The initial state after the experiment is created
2. Running - The active state where the experiment is assigning subjects and/or updating the metric event data
3. Ready for Review - The state where a decision can be made, either because the primary metric is statistically significant for a sequential/Bayesian test, the precision target has been hit, or the end date has been reached. The experiment may still be assigning subjects and/or updating the metric event data if the end date has not yet been reached.
4. Wrap Up - The state where the end date of the experiment has been reached and Eppo is no longer automatically updating results, but requirements to make a decision have not been met
5. Completed - The state where a decision regarding the experiment has been made

If you hover on the progress bar for an experiment you can view more details about why your experiment has reached that status.
