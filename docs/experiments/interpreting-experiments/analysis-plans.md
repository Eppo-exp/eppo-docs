# Analysis plans

A central goal of running an experiment is to use data to make decisions that
are rigorous and repeatable; an **analysis plan** is a set of choices and
parameters that will govern how Eppo translates the experiment data into
dashboards and visualizationsâ€“and thus into ship/no-ship decisions.

In general, an experimentaiton program is most effective if decisions are made
in a consistent way across an entire company, and so most of the analysis plan
settings can be set on the
[administration](../../administration/setting-statistical-analysis-plan-defaults.md)
page. However, occasionally you may want to have different settings for certain
individual experiments; for example, a website that connects homeowners to
contractors is likely to have many more users who are homeowners than
contractors, and therefore might use a different statistical approach for an
experiment on the contractor on-boarding flow than on the homeowners' search
page.
