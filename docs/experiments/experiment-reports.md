# Summarize Experiment Learnings with Reports

Anyone with an Experiment Editor role or higher can edit the information on the Overview tab of an experiment. Those with a Viewer role can see the content, but cannot edit. 

On the overview tab you can summarize the learnings of your experiment by filling in your hypothesis, key takeaways, and decision. Help centralize your documentation by adding links to relevant planning docs, figma files, issue tracking, and more.

## Adding Cards and Blocks
Cards allow you to further customize your experiment report. Each card acts like a page where you can add text and experiment blocks. If you are familiar with Notion, Eppo reports uses a similar pattern with the page and block model. This includes using the slash (/) command to open up the menu to select from available blocks. Alternativey, you can add blocks by clicking on the plus icon when hovering over an existing block.
