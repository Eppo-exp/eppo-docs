# Guardrail metrics

A guardrail metric refers to a specific type of metric in Eppo that is set as a standard measurement for every experiment.
By configuring a metric as a guardrail, it is automatically included in the analysis of all applicable experiments, ensuring consistent tracking and comparison of results.
This approach enables you to establish a uniform measurement framework, allowing you to monitor and evaluate key performance indicators consistently across various tests, providing valuable insights and facilitating data-driven decision-making processes.
