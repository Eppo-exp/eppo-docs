# Eppo Feature Flags

Feature flags enable you to easily toggle features on and off, conduct A/B/n testing, gradually roll out new functionality, and personalize user experiences â€” all without the need for extensive code deployments. With feature flags, you can empower your team to make dynamic changes, iterate quickly, and deliver enhanced user experiences with ease.

:::info
This section of the docs covers configuring feature flags and experiments in Eppo's UI. For developer guides on integrating Eppo into your tech stack, please see the [SDKs](/sdks) section.
