In Eppo, you can schedule enabling or disabling a Feature Flag in Production. To do so, click the clock icon next to the flag enable/disable toggle. You are able to select a date and time for the change to take effect.

Flags that are scheduled can also be rescheduled. Click the `Reschedule` button on the banner to select a new date and time or to cancel the current scheduled change.

Note that a flag cannot be toggled on or off when a scheduled action is active.
