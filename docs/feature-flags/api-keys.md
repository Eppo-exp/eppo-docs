# SDK Keys

You will need to initialize whichever SDK you choose with a SDK key. The SDK uses this key to authenticate requests to Eppo's API for retrieving your experiment variations. Do not share your SDK token with anyone outside your organization.

### Navigate to **SDK Keys** section of the **Feature Flags** tab

There is no limit to the number of SDK keys per environment. Once keys are generated, they can be used to initialize the SDK in the given environment.
