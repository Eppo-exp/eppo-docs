# Creating assignment table from LaunchDarkly

_Note:_ this guide assumes that you have already integrated LaunchDarkly feature flags into your code.

1. Find all places in your code where your feature flags are being invoked.

**Find the SDK that you're using in the [LaunchDarkly SDK documentation](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/sdk) and identify the syntax you're searching for.**

LaunchDarklyâ€™s SDK exposes methods for retrieving whether or not a feature is enabled for the current user. 


<Tabs>
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```js
const variation = client.variation("YOUR_EXPERIMENT_KEY", "control");
if (variation == "variant_abc") {
  // show the variant you are testing
} else if (variation == "control") {
  // show control
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="react" label="React">

```js
import { withLDConsumer } from 'launchdarkly-react-client-sdk';

const Home = ({ flags, ldClient /*, ...otherProps */ }) => {
  // if the devTestFlag is on, then show one kind of div; if not, show the other.
  return flags.devTestFlag ? <div>Flag on</div> : <div>Flag off</div>;
};

export default withLDConsumer()(Home);
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

2. Log all feature flag invocations.

In order to capture assignment data, every time the feature flag is invoked, you need to log the user, timestamp, and which experiment and variant they're seeing

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```js
function checkFeatureEnabled(experimentKey, defaultValue) {
  // determine whether or not this feature is enabled for the current user
  const variation = client.variation(experimentKey, defaultValue);

  // eventService here is the system you use for logging arbitrary events
  // which ultimately end up in your data warehouse. The format/structure
  // of sending these events will vary based on the interface of that system.
  eventService.logEvent({
    event_name: "ExperimentAssignmentEvent",
    event_params: {
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
      user_id: ID_OF_THE_CURRENT_USER,
      experiment: experimentKey,
      variation: variation,
      device_id: DEVICE_ID,
    },
  });

  // return the variation
  return variation;
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

You need to ensure that all usages of feature flags (or at least those you wish to run an experiment on) are wrapped with this new function you created.

It is possible that an engineer on your team could call this new function before showing the new feature to the user. Be sure that the assignment event is only sent once the user experiences the feature you are experimenting on.
