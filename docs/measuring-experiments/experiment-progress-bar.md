# Experiment Progress Bar

Each experiment has an associated progress bar at the top. This bar measures the progress of the experiment towards detecting the minimum detectable effect configured for the primary metric for that experiment. 

To view the progress bar, you must first navigate to the **Experiments** tab from the left panel. The progress bar can be seen in the list item card for each experiment in the experiment list. It can also be seen in the right panel if you click the card. Hovering over the progress bar shows you more details like the % lift that can be detected with the assignments seen so far.
