# Quickstarts

This section walks you through the initial set up of Eppo. Whether you are using Eppo as an end-to-end experimentation platform, integrating with an existing feature flagging system, or using Eppo solely for feature flagging, this section will get you running on Eppo in a series of 10-minute quickstart guides.

- [Initial setup](/setup-quickstart/) - Start here to set up some basic information in your Eppo instance.
- [Your first metric](/metric-quickstart) - Use this guide to start annotating where existing data lives in your data warehouse and how it should be used to analyze experiments.
- [Your first feature flag](/feature-flag-quickstart/) - This guide walks through the integration of our SDK into your application. If you are using Eppo in combination with an existing feature flagging or randomization system you can skip this guide. 
- [Your first experiment analysis](/experiment-quickstart/) - Once you have metrics and assignment logs set up in Eppo, use this guide to start measuring the impact of your experiments.
