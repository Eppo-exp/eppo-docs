# How Eppo Works

![How Eppo Works](../static/img/building-experiments/how-eppo-works.png)

There are four pieces to Eppo:

1. **Use your feature flagging tool of choice to generate experiment data into your data warehouse**

2. **Connect your data warehouse**

   Currently Eppo supports:

- [Snowflake](./connecting-data/data-warehouses/connecting-to-snowflake.md)
- Redshift
- [BigQuery](./connecting-data/data-warehouses/connecting-to-bigquery.md)

3. **Build your experiments by writing SQL**

4. **Monitor your experiments' progress**

5. **Share experiment results with Eppo dashboards**
