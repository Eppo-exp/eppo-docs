# Experiment tags

Tags allow you to organize your experiments in the Analysis and Insights sections. This makes it easier to filter and see results from relevant experiments.

## Creating and managing tags

Tags can be created and managed in the Admin section. Each tag has a name and a description.

Clicking edit allows you to see all experiments, SDK keys, and flags using the tag and allows you to remove them.

## Tagging Experiments

In experiments, you can optionally choose tags to add by clicking on the info icon in the header of the page. This opens a side panel where you can add and manage tags.

## Filtering with Tags

Once an experiment is tagged, the tag icon will be highlighted and tags will display on hover.

Tags can be useful to organize your list of experiments. Use the filter button and select the appropriate tags to only see experiments with those included tags in the list.

Tags can also be used to filter in the Insights section. Filter for the Aggregate Impact made by experiments with a given tag in the Performance Scorecard or drill down to specific learnings in the Knowledge Base.
