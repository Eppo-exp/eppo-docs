# Entities

Entities are a Eppo concept that refers to who or what is involved in the experiment, fact, or dimension. Some examples are people, products, or locations.

Assignment, Dimension, and Fact SQL's can be attached to entities -- for example, an assignment SQL attached to a user would pull the assignments of users into different experiment groups.
