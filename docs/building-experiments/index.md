# Building Experiments

In Eppo, you can build your experiments using a few core building blocks.

- [Entities](./entities.md)
- [Definitions](./definitions/)
- [Metrics](./metrics/)
- [Experiments](./experiments/)

More specifically, you start by defining Entities, then use those Entities to craft Definitions, then use the Definitions to build Metrics, and finally add Metrics to Experiments.
