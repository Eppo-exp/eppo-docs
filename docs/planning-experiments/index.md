# Planning Experiments

Eppo's Sample Size Calculator operates on top of your data to automatically suggest how many subjects you'll need for an experiment.

### Quickstart

1. From the **[Definitions](https://eppo.cloud/definitions)** page, create a new **[Entry Point SQL](./setting_up_the_sample_size_calculator#creating-entry-points)**.
2. Visit the **Sample Size Calculator** from the **[Experiments](https://eppo.cloud/experiments)** page. 
3. Select your **Entry Point** and manually refresh its data. (Entry Point data [refreshes automatically on a weekly basis.](./setting_up_the_sample_size_calculator#refreshing-entry-point-data))
4. Calculate the number of users you'll need for your experiment [using Eppo](./using_the_sample_size_calculator)!
